```

**Key Elements**:
- **Input**: Target repository with standard project structure
- **Decision Points**: Analysis depth (full content vs. structure-only), output format selection
- **Outputs**: Primary analysis document and structured overview for AI consumption
- **Validation Steps**: Tool validation, output completeness, and artifact readiness verification

### Step 1: Validate Repomix Installation

<step>

**Action**: Verify that repomix is installed and executable on your system before proceeding with analysis.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Primary validation command
command -v repomix

# Alternative validation if not in PATH
which repomix

# Fallback location checks
ls ~/.local/bin/repomix
ls ./node_modules/.bin/repomix

# Confirm executable status
repomix --version
```

**Expected Result**: Command should return the path to repomix executable and version information. If repomix is properly installed, you should see output like `/usr/local/bin/repomix` and version details.

**Verification**: The `repomix --version` command should execute successfully and display version information without errors.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If repomix is not found, install it using `npm install -g repomix` or check the official installation documentation. Ensure your PATH includes the installation directory.

### Step 2: Discover Tool Capabilities

<step>

**Action**: Understand available repomix options, flags, and configuration possibilities to select optimal analysis settings.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Display all available options and usage information
repomix --help

# Review common flags for analysis
# --style: Output format (markdown, xml, plain)
# --compress: Enable content compression
# --remove-empty-lines: Clean output formatting
# --no-files: Structure-only analysis
# --include-empty-directories: Show complete directory structure
# --ignore: Exclude specific file patterns
# -o: Specify output file location
```

**Expected Result**: Comprehensive help output showing all available flags, options, usage examples, and configuration override possibilities.

**Verification**: You should understand compression options, styling formats, filtering capabilities, and output customization before proceeding.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If help output is unclear, refer to repomix documentation. Most flags are optional and have sensible defaults for standard analysis.

### Step 3: Execute Comprehensive Analysis

<step>

**Action**: Run repomix with optimal configuration to generate comprehensive codebase analysis with proper output location.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Primary recommended command for comprehensive analysis
repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-empty-lines -o docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# For large repositories (structure-only analysis)
repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories -o docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-structure.md

# For deep analysis (uncompressed with full content)
repomix --style markdown -o docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-full.md

# Custom filtering example (exclude noise files)
repomix --style markdown --compress --ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules" -o docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Config override (if repository has repomix.config.json)
repomix --style markdown --compress -o docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-custom.md
```

**Expected Result**: Successful command execution with complete output file generation. The command should process all repository files and generate comprehensive markdown analysis without truncation or errors.

**Verification**: Check that the output file exists at the specified location and contains complete directory structure, file metadata, and content analysis sections.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If analysis fails, check disk space, file permissions, and repository size. For very large repositories, use `--no-files` flag for structure-only analysis. Ensure output directory exists or create it beforehand.

### Step 4: Extract and Catalog Repository Structure

<step>

**Action**: Process the generated repomix output to extract directory structure, file inventory, and repository metadata for structured analysis.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Open and examine the generated analysis file
cat docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md | head -100

# Extract directory structure section
grep -A 50 "Directory Structure" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Count total files processed
grep -c "^##\|^###" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Examine file classification patterns
grep -E "\.(js|ts|py|go|rs|java|cpp)" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md | head -20
```

**Expected Result**: Successful extraction of ASCII directory tree, complete file listing with types and sizes, and repository processing metadata including exclusion patterns and compression settings.

**Verification**: Confirm that directory structure is complete, file classifications are accurate, and metadata includes total file counts and processing configuration.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If sections are missing, re-run repomix with different flags. Large repositories might need `--compress` for manageable output size.

### Step 5: Comprehensive Content Analysis

<step>

**Action**: Read and analyze the complete repomix output file to understand repository structure, technology stack, development patterns, and configuration details.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Read complete file for comprehensive analysis
less docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Search for specific technology patterns
grep -i "package\.json\|cargo\.toml\|requirements\.txt\|go\.mod" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Identify build and automation patterns
grep -i "makefile\|justfile\|dockerfile\|\.github" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Find configuration and environment files
grep -E "\.(env|config|yml|yaml|toml|ini)" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Analyze documentation structure
grep -i "readme\|docs/\|\.md" docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md
```

**Expected Result**: Complete understanding of project type, technology stack, development tools, configuration patterns, documentation structure, and automation workflows.

**Verification**: You should be able to identify the primary programming languages, frameworks, build tools, testing setups, and development environment requirements.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: For very large outputs, use `grep` with specific patterns to focus analysis. Consider using `--compress` flag if output is overwhelming.

### Step 6: Generate Structured Overview Document

<step>

**Action**: Create a comprehensive but lightweight repository overview document that synthesizes repomix analysis findings into organized, consumable format.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Create the overview document
touch docs/00_context_engineering/codebase-awareness-overview.md

# Template structure for manual completion:
cat > docs/00_context_engineering/codebase-awareness-overview.md << 'EOF'
# Repository Overview: [Repository Name]

**Source Reference**: `repomix-analysis.md` (for detailed queries)

## Repomix Analysis Metadata
- **Analysis Date**: [Current Date]
- **Total Files Processed**: [X files from analysis]
- **Content Processing**: [Compressed/Full/Structure-only]
- **Exclusion Patterns**: [Ignored file patterns]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph repository overview based on repomix findings]

## Repository Classification
- **Project Type**: [Web App/CLI Tool/Library/Template]
- **Primary Language(s)**: [Languages from file analysis]
- **Development Status**: [Active/Template/Archived]

## Technology Stack Analysis
[Technology details from configuration files]

## Development Environment Configuration
[Build tools, task runners, CI/CD from repomix]

## Quick Reference Guide
[Key files, commands, entry points identified]
EOF
```

**Expected Result**: Well-structured overview document containing executive summary, repository classification, technology analysis, and quick reference information derived from repomix analysis.

**Verification**: Overview document should provide immediate repository understanding while properly referencing the detailed repomix analysis file.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If manual creation is complex, use templates or scripts to automate overview generation based on repomix output patterns.

### Step 7: Validate Artifacts and Presentation

<step>

**Action**: Perform final validation to ensure both analysis and overview documents are complete, accurate, and ready for downstream consumption.

**Command/Code**:

```bash
# Verify primary artifact exists and has content
ls -la docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md
wc -l docs/00_context_engineering/repomix-analysis.md

# Verify overview document exists and references primary artifact
ls -la docs/00_context_engineering/codebase-awareness-overview.md
grep -i "repomix-analysis.md" docs/00_context_engineering/codebase-awareness-overview.md

# Check for proper cross-references and relative paths
grep -E "\.\./" docs/00_context_engineering/codebase-awareness-overview.md

# Validate markdown formatting
markdownlint docs/00_context_engineering/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Markdown validation complete"

# Generate final artifact confirmation
echo "✅ Repository analysis complete"
echo "📁 Primary artifact: repomix-analysis.md"
echo "📄 Overview document: codebase-awareness-overview.md"
```

**Expected Result**: Both artifacts exist with proper content, cross-references are functional, and documents are ready for AI consumption and downstream context engineering processes.

**Verification**: Final confirmation shows successful artifact creation with proper file sizes, cross-references, and markdown formatting compliance.

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: If validation fails, review file permissions, check relative path accuracy, and ensure both documents contain required sections and proper formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<troubleshooting>

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Repomix command not found or installation failures

- **Symptoms**: `command not found` errors when running repomix commands
- **Cause**: Tool not installed or not in system PATH
- **Solution**: Install repomix using `npm install -g repomix` and verify PATH configuration
- **Prevention**: Use `command -v repomix` before starting analysis to verify installation

**Issue**: Analysis output truncated or incomplete

- **Symptoms**: Generated file missing sections or appears cut off
- **Cause**: Large repository size exceeding memory limits or disk space constraints
- **Solution**: Use `--compress` flag or `--no-files` for structure-only analysis
- **Prevention**: Check available disk space and use appropriate flags for repository size

**Issue**: Empty or minimal analysis output

- **Symptoms**: Repomix generates file but with minimal content
- **Cause**: Repository lacks standard files or all content excluded by default patterns
- **Solution**: Review exclusion patterns and use `--include-empty-directories` flag
- **Prevention**: Examine repository structure before analysis and adjust ignore patterns

**Issue**: Permission errors during analysis or file creation

- **Symptoms**: Access denied errors when reading repository or writing output
- **Cause**: Insufficient file permissions or write access to output directory
- **Solution**: Check file permissions and ensure output directory exists and is writable
- **Prevention**: Verify read access to repository and write access to output location

### Error Messages

**Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory`

- **Meaning**: Output directory doesn't exist or path is incorrect
- **Resolution**: Create output directory or verify path accuracy before running repomix

**Error**: `Error: Repository too large for analysis`

- **Meaning**: Repository exceeds repomix processing limits
- **Resolution**: Use `--no-files` flag for structure-only analysis or exclude large directories

**Error**: `Permission denied: cannot read repository`

- **Meaning**: Insufficient permissions to access repository files
- **Resolution**: Check file permissions and ensure read access to all repository directories

### Debugging Strategies

1. **Incremental Analysis**: Start with structure-only analysis (`--no-files`) then add content if needed
2. **Verbose Output**: Use debug flags if available to understand processing issues
3. **Manual Verification**: Compare repomix output with manual directory listing to verify completeness
4. **Alternative Approaches**: If repomix fails, use standard tools (`find`, `tree`) for basic structure analysis

### Recovery Procedures

**Scenario**: Analysis fails due to memory or size constraints

- **Recovery Steps**: 
  1. Clear system memory and close unnecessary applications
  2. Use `--compress` and `--no-files` flags for minimal analysis
  3. Exclude large directories using `--ignore` patterns
  4. Process repository in smaller chunks if needed
- **Data Safety**: Original repository remains unchanged; only output files affected

**Scenario**: Corrupted or incomplete output files

- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Delete incomplete output files
  2. Re-run analysis with different configuration
  3. Verify repository integrity and file permissions
  4. Use alternative output formats if markdown fails
- **Data Safety**: Re-running analysis overwrites previous output but preserves repository

# Repository Prompt Engineering Optimization Rule

## Description

This rule implements Anthropic's world-class prompt engineering methodologies specifically for creating, improving, and optimizing prompts within this repository template. It enforces systematic prompt construction using Anthropic's proven frameworks including structured elements, XML organization, prefilling techniques, and step-by-step reasoning protocols. This rule is tailored for prompt engineering work on documentation templates, context engineering, and AI-assisted development workflows.

## Rule

### 1. Mandatory Documentation Reference
- **ALWAYS** consult `docs/ai/04_ai_documentation/04.1_anthropic_prompt_engineering/` before creating or improving prompts
- Reference specific guides for targeted techniques:
  - Clear and direct communication patterns (`anthropic-be-clear-direct-and-detailed.md`)
  - XML tag structuring methodologies (`anthropic-use-xml-tags-to-structure-your-prompts.md`)
  - Example-driven (few-shot) prompting (`anthropic-use-examples-multishot-prompting-to-guide-claudes-behavior.md`)
  - Chain of thought reasoning (`anthropic-let-claude-think-chain-of-thought-prompting-to-increase-performance.md`)
  - Prefill response control (`anthropic-prefill-claudes-response-for-greater-output-control.md`)
  - Hallucination reduction strategies (`anthropic-reduce-hallucinations.md`)
  - Long context optimization (`anthropic-long-context-prompting-tips.md`)
  - Role prompting and character maintenance (`anthropic-keep-claude-in-character-with-role-prompting-and-prefilling.md`)
  - Extended thinking integration (`anthropic-building-with-extended-thinking.md`, `anthropic-extending-thinking.md`)
  - Complex prompt chaining (`anthropic-chain-complex-prompts-for-stronger-performance.md`)
  - Best practices overview (`anthropic-claude-4-prompt-engineering-best-practices.md`)

### 2. Structured Prompt Architecture (MANDATORY)
Construct ALL prompts using this systematic 8-element framework:

#### Element 1: User Role Declaration
- Begin Messages API calls with `user` role in messages array
- Establish clear communication initiation

#### Element 2: Task Context
- Define AI's role, goals, and overarching objectives
- Position early in prompt body for maximum effectiveness
- Example: `"You are an expert technical writer creating API documentation"`

#### Element 3: Tone Context (Optional)
- Specify desired response tone when interaction-critical
- Examples: "professional", "friendly", "authoritative", "conversational"

#### Element 4: Detailed Task Description and Rules
- Expand specific tasks with clear operational rules
- Provide explicit "out" clauses for uncertainty handling
- Use logical, unambiguous language validated by third-party review

#### Element 5: Examples (HIGH IMPACT)
- Provide minimum one ideal response example using `<example></example>` XML tags
- Include multiple examples for complex scenarios with clear context labels
- Cover edge cases and scratchpad usage patterns
- **Rule**: More examples = superior performance

#### Element 6: Input Data Processing
- Enclose all processable data within relevant XML tags
- Use multiple tagged sections for different data types
- Examples: `<document>`, `<query>`, `<context>`, `<history>`

#### Element 7: Immediate Task Request
- Restate specific expected action at prompt end
- Reinforce primary objective for long prompts

#### Element 8: Advanced Techniques
- **Precognition**: Add step-by-step thinking instructions
- **Output Formatting**: Specify exact response structure using XML tags
- **Prefilling**: Guide initial response direction

### 3. XML Structuring Protocol (MANDATORY)
- Use XML tags for ALL structured content organization
- Tag examples: `<task>`, `<context>`, `<example>`, `<rules>`, `<output>`
- Implement hierarchical tagging for complex nested information
- Apply consistent tag naming conventions throughout prompts

### 4. Prefill Response Control
- Use prefill parameter to guide response initiation
- Structure responses with opening XML tags when appropriate
- Control output format and reduce unwanted preambles
- Example: Prefill with `"<analysis>"` for analytical responses

### 5. Chain of Thought Integration
- Include explicit step-by-step reasoning instructions
- Position thinking prompts before final response requests
- Use phrases: "Think through this step by step", "Before answering, consider"
- Implement scratchpad techniques for complex problem-solving

### 6. Hallucination Reduction
- Request explicit uncertainty acknowledgment when knowledge is incomplete
- Use grounding techniques with provided source material
- Implement verification steps in multi-stage prompts
- Include confidence indicators in responses

### 7. Quality Validation Checklist
Before deploying any prompt, verify:
- [ ] All 8 structural elements present where applicable
- [ ] XML tags properly nested and closed
- [ ] Examples demonstrate desired vs. undesired patterns
- [ ] Task description is unambiguous and actionable
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Edge cases addressed through examples or rules

## Implementation

### Cursor IDE Integration
- This rule activates for markdown, text, code, and JSON files where prompts are commonly developed
- Applies globally (`alwaysApply: true`) to ensure consistent prompt engineering standards
- Integrates with Cursor's AI assistance to suggest Anthropic-compliant prompt improvements
- Triggers validation warnings for prompts missing core structural elements

### Workflow Integration
1. **Prompt Creation**: Start with Anthropic documentation review
2. **Structure Application**: Apply 8-element framework systematically
3. **Example Development**: Create comprehensive example sets
4. **Testing**: Validate prompt effectiveness against success criteria
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on output quality and consistency

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Well-Structured Anthropic Prompt

```markdown
# Task Context
You are an expert technical documentation writer specializing in API reference materials.

# Task Description and Rules
Create comprehensive API documentation that includes:
1. Clear endpoint descriptions
2. Parameter specifications with types
3. Example requests and responses
4. Error handling information
5. If uncertain about technical details, state "I need clarification on [specific aspect]"

# Examples
<example>
User: Document the /users/create endpoint
Response: 
## POST /users/create
Creates a new user account in the system.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (string, required): Unique username
- `email` (string, required): Valid email address

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```
</example>

# Input Data
<api_spec>
{{API_SPECIFICATION}}
</api_spec>

# Immediate Task
Document the API endpoint provided above following the established format.

# Output Formatting
Provide your documentation in <documentation></documentation> tags.
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Poorly Structured Prompt

```markdown
Write API docs for this endpoint. Make it good and comprehensive. Include examples.

{{API_ENDPOINT_INFO}}
```

### ✅ Correct: Multi-Element Career Coaching Prompt

```python
# Complete structured prompt implementation
TASK_CONTEXT = "You are an AI career coach named Joe created by AdAstra Careers. Your goal is to provide career advice to users on the AdAstra platform."

TONE_CONTEXT = "Maintain a friendly, professional customer service tone."

TASK_DESCRIPTION = """Rules for interaction:
- Always stay in character as Joe from AdAstra Careers
- For uncertainty: "Sorry, I didn't understand. Could you rephrase?"
- For irrelevant topics: "I'm Joe and I give career advice. Do you have a career question?"""

EXAMPLES = """<example>
User: Hi, how were you created?
Joe: Hello! I'm Joe, created by AdAstra Careers to provide career advice. What can I help you with today?
</example>"""

INPUT_DATA = f"""<conversation_history>
{HISTORY}
</conversation_history>

<user_question>
{QUESTION}
</user_question>"""

IMMEDIATE_TASK = "Respond to the user's question based on the conversation history and your role as a career coach."
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Unstructured Career Coaching Attempt

```python
PROMPT = "You're a career coach. Help users with career questions. Be helpful."
```

# Cursor Documentation Clarity Enforcement Rule

## Description

This rule mandates that Cursor proactively analyzes documentation during editing to detect redundancies and jargon violations that compromise clarity. When editing any documentation, Cursor must alert users to redundant content, unnecessary jargon, and clarity violations even if the user hasn't spotted them. This enforcement is particularly critical for prompt-engineering and context-engineering tasks where precision and clarity are paramount.

**Core Principle**: Jargon-free and redundancy-free documentation is the law.

## Rule

1. **Mandatory Redundancy Detection**: Scan for and alert about:
   - **Tautologies**: Statements making the same point in different ways
   - **Pleonasms**: Phrases containing unnecessary words
   - **Repetitive Content**: Identical concepts restated without adding value
   - **Verbose Explanations**: Content that can be simplified without losing meaning

2. **Jargon Violation Detection**: Identify and suggest replacements for:
   - **Undefined Technical Terms**: Domain-specific vocabulary without explanation
   - **Unexplained Abbreviations**: Acronyms/initialisms used without definition
   - **Industry Jargon**: Professional terminology that excludes non-experts
   - **Complex Language**: Unnecessarily sophisticated words when simpler alternatives exist

3. **Prompt-Engineering Clarity Focus**: Apply stricter standards for:
   - **Prompt Design Documents**: Eliminate ambiguous instructions and undefined terms
   - **Context-Engineering Guidelines**: Ensure every directive is immediately actionable
   - **AI Interaction Specifications**: Remove meta-discourse and verbose explanations
   - **Template Documentation**: Maintain consistency in terminology and format

4. **Proactive Alert Protocol**:
   - Alert immediately upon detecting violations during editing
   - Provide specific line references for identified issues
   - Suggest concrete replacements for jargon and redundant content
   - Highlight inconsistent terminology across the document

5. **Clarity Enforcement Standards**:
   - Replace weak language ("might", "could", "perhaps") with definitive statements
   - Eliminate meta-discourse ("as mentioned above", "you should know")
   - Ensure active voice and clear subject identification
   - Maintain terminology consistency throughout documents

6. **Documentation Type Sensitivity**: Apply appropriate standards based on:
   - **Technical Specifications**: High precision, defined terminology
   - **User Guides**: Accessible language, minimal jargon
   - **API Documentation**: Consistent naming, clear examples
   - **Process Documentation**: Step-by-step clarity, no ambiguity

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will:
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuously scan content during editing for redundancy and jargon patterns
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Display contextual warnings with specific violation details and improvement suggestions
- **Terminology Database**: Maintain project-specific glossaries to ensure consistency
- **Severity Classification**: Distinguish between critical clarity issues and minor improvements
- **Automated Suggestions**: Provide one-click replacements for common jargon and redundancy patterns
- **Document Type Recognition**: Apply appropriate clarity standards based on file location and content type

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Clear, Redundancy-Free Content

```markdown
# API Authentication

Use API keys to authenticate requests.

## Setup Steps
1. Generate API key in dashboard
2. Add key to request headers
3. Test connection

## Required Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}
```

## Error Handling
- 401: Invalid key
- 403: Insufficient permissions
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Redundant and Jargon-Heavy Content

```markdown
# API Authentication Implementation and Configuration

In order to properly authenticate API requests in your application, 
you need to utilize API keys for the authentication process. This 
authentication mechanism allows you to authenticate and verify requests.

## Setup and Configuration Steps
1. You should generate an API key in the dashboard interface
2. After generating the key, you need to add the key to your request headers
3. Once you've added the headers, test the connection to verify functionality

## Required Headers for Authentication
```
Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- 401 Unauthorized: This indicates an invalid key was provided
- 403 Forbidden: This means insufficient permissions were granted

Problems:
- "authentication process" → redundant with "authenticate"
- "authentication mechanism" → jargon
- "interface" → unnecessary qualifier
- "Once you've added" → verbose meta-discourse
- Repetitive explanations of obvious concepts
```

### ✅ Correct: Prompt-Engineering Clarity

```markdown
# Context Engineering Rule Template

## Rule Structure
1. Define specific behavior
2. Include concrete examples
3. Specify output format

## Implementation
- Use imperative commands
- Avoid conditional language
- Reference exact file paths

## Validation
Test rule effectiveness with sample inputs.
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Prompt-Engineering Jargon

```markdown
# Context Engineering Rule Template and Guidelines

When you're designing context engineering rules, you should consider
implementing a comprehensive framework that leverages best practices
for prompt optimization and contextual directive specification.

## Rule Structure and Architecture
1. You need to define specific behavioral parameters
2. It's important to include concrete illustrative examples
3. You should specify the desired output format and structure

## Implementation Guidelines and Best Practices
- You should utilize imperative command structures when possible
- It's recommended to avoid conditional or ambiguous language constructs
- Consider referencing exact file paths for optimal specificity

## Validation and Testing Procedures
You should test rule effectiveness using sample inputs to ensure
proper functionality and optimal performance characteristics.

Problems:
- "comprehensive framework" → jargon
- "leverages best practices" → business speak
- "behavioral parameters" → technical jargon
- "illustrative examples" → redundant
- "language constructs" → unnecessary complexity
- Verbose meta-discourse throughout
```

### Visual Clarity Patterns

```
Documentation Clarity Hierarchy:

High Clarity:
├── Direct statements ✅
├── Concrete examples ✅
├── Consistent terminology ✅
└── Active voice ✅

Medium Clarity:
├── Some technical terms (defined) ⚠️
├── Passive voice occasionally ⚠️
└── Minor redundancy ⚠️

Low Clarity:
├── Undefined jargon ❌
├── Repetitive content ❌
├── Meta-discourse ❌
└── Ambiguous instructions ❌

# Repository Context Review

## Description

This rule mandates that Cursor always performs a comprehensive repository context review and understanding of the codebase structure using `repomix` (available in the system) before executing any development tasks. This ensures informed decision-making based on complete project knowledge including architecture, patterns, dependencies, and configuration.

## Rule

Execute this mandatory context review protocol for every repository task:

1. **Initial Repository Analysis**: Execute `repomix` to generate comprehensive, AI-friendly codebase representation before task execution.

2. **Configuration Awareness**: Reference project-specific `repomix.config.json` file located at repository root containing:
   - Schema validation: Latest repomix schema for IDE autocomplete and validation
   - Output format: XML style with template-specific header for AI analysis
   - Compression: Enabled for token optimization and faster AI processing
   - File size limits: 50MB maximum for large repository handling
   - Git integration: Sorts files by change frequency with 100 commit analysis
   - Security checks: Enabled for sensitive data protection
   - Template-optimized ignore patterns: Comprehensive exclusion of build artifacts, logs, and system files
   - Empty directories: Included to show complete repository structure
   - Token encoding: o200k_base for optimal AI model compatibility

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyze repomix output to understand:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Key dependencies and configuration files
   - Code patterns and architectural decisions
   - File relationships and imports
   - Documentation and setup requirements

4. **Context-Informed Actions**: Base all development decisions on comprehensive codebase understanding rather than assumptions.

5. **Configuration Optimization**: Leverage the optimized repomix configuration which includes:
   - Schema validation with official repomix schema for enhanced IDE support
   - Compression enabled for token efficiency and faster AI processing
   - Template-specific header text for clear context identification

   - Git change tracking for prioritizing recently modified files (100 commit analysis)
   - Security scanning enabled for sensitive data protection
   - Empty directory inclusion for complete repository structure visualization
   - Increased top files display (10 files) for better project overview

## Implementation

### Technical Integration

```bash
# Always run repomix first to understand repository context
repomix

# The command will use the optimized repomix.config.json configuration:
# - Schema validation enabled for enhanced development experience
# - Outputs to repomix-output.xml with template-specific header
# - Compression enabled for token optimization
# - Comprehensive ignore patterns for template repositories
# - Git change analysis with 100 commit history
# - Security scanning for sensitive data protection
# - Empty directory inclusion for complete structure view
# - Enhanced top files display (10 files) for better overview
# - Uses o200k_base token encoding for optimal AI compatibility
```

### Workflow Integration

1. **Pre-Task Execution**: Execute `repomix` before coding, debugging, or architectural decisions
2. **Configuration Reference**: Check project's `repomix.config.json` for specific settings
3. **Output Analysis**: Review generated `repomix-output.xml` for complete project context

- **Reduced Refactoring**: Understand the codebase structure to implement changes correctly the first time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify reusable components and established patterns

### Better Collaboration
- **Documentation**: Understand project documentation and setup requirements
- **Team Conventions**: Follow established coding patterns and organizational standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive understanding reduces onboarding time

### Risk Mitigation
- **Security Awareness**: Leverage built-in security scanning
- **Change Impact**: Understand how modifications affect other parts of the system
- **Configuration Compliance**: Respect project-specific settings and constraints

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Always start with repository context review
repomix

# Step 2: Analyze the generated repomix-output.xml to understand:
# - Project structure in the directory structure section
# - Key files and their purposes in the file summary
# - Dependencies in package.json or similar config files
# - Git activity patterns for recently changed areas

# Step 3: Proceed with informed development decisions
# Example: Implementing a new feature
# - Check existing similar implementations
# - Follow established patterns
# - Understand dependency requirements
# - Respect configuration constraints
```

**Repository Structure Understanding:**
```
project-root/
├── repomix.config.json     # ← Project-specific repomix configuration
├── repomix-output.xml      # ← Generated context file
├── src/                    # ← Source code (understand patterns)
├── docs/                   # ← Documentation (read setup requirements)
├── scripts/                # ← Automation (understand workflows)
└── justfile               # ← Build automation (understand commands)
```

### ❌ Incorrect Approach

```bash
# ❌ Starting development without context understanding
npm install some-package

# ❌ Modifying files without understanding project structure
edit src/main.js

# ❌ Making architectural decisions without codebase knowledge
mkdir new-feature-directory

# ❌ Ignoring project-specific repomix configuration
repomix --style plain --no-security-check  # Overrides project settings
```

### Context-Aware Development Pattern

```bash
# ✅ Proper workflow for any development task
repomix  # Uses project's repomix.config.json automatically

# Analyze output for:
# 1. Existing similar functionality
# 2. Project conventions and patterns
# 3. Dependencies and their usage
# 4. Documentation and setup requirements
# 5. Recent changes and active development areas

# Then proceed with informed implementation
```

### Configuration-Aware Usage

The project's `repomix.config.json` is optimized for template repositories with:
- **Schema Validation**: Latest repomix schema (`$schema`) for enhanced IDE support and validation
- **Compression Enabled**: Reduces token count while preserving essential structure and context
- **Template-Specific Header**: Clear identification as "Repository Template" for AI analysis context
- **50MB file size limit**: Handles large repositories efficiently for comprehensive analysis
- **XML output format**: Structured data optimized for AI processing and parsing
- **Enhanced Top Files Display**: Shows 10 most important files for better project overview
- **Git integration**: Prioritizes recently changed files with 100 commit analysis depth
- **Security scanning**: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data and credentials
- **Comprehensive ignore patterns**: Excludes build artifacts, system files, logs, and development byproducts
- **Empty directory inclusion**: Shows complete repository structure for template understanding
- **Token optimization**: Uses o200k_base encoding for optimal AI model compatibility

Always respect these configurations as they are specifically optimized for template repository analysis and AI-assisted development workflows.

# Auto-Repomix on Technology Changes

## Description

Execute `repomix` command automatically when new technologies, dependencies, or significant configuration changes are detected to maintain current repository analysis for AI tools.

## Rule

Execute `repomix` when these technology files change:

1. **Package Dependencies**: On modification of `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`
2. **Build Configurations**: On creation/modification of `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
3. **New Languages**: On first occurrence of new file extensions (`.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.py`)
4. **Major Config Changes**: On modification of build tool configs (`webpack.config.js`, `vite.config.js`)

### Execution Command

```bash
repomix  # Uses existing repomix.config.json configuration
```

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Monitors technology files for changes
- Triggers repomix execution automatically
- Prevents outdated repository analysis

**Technical Enforcement:**
- File watcher on specified glob patterns
- Automatic command execution on change detection
- Uses existing `repomix.config.json` settings

## Benefits

1. **Current Analysis**: Keeps repository context up-to-date for AI tools
2. **Automatic Execution**: No manual repomix command required
3. **Technology-Aware**: Triggers only on meaningful changes
4. **Efficient**: Uses optimized repomix configuration

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Trigger Events

**Adding TypeScript:**
```bash
# Changes detected:
package.json (+ typescript dependency)
tsconfig.json (new file)

# Automatic action:
repomix  # Regenerates analysis with TypeScript files
```

**Adding Docker:**
```bash
# Changes detected:
Dockerfile (new file)

# Automatic action:
repomix  # Updates analysis to include Docker configuration
```

### ❌ Incorrect Manual Usage

```bash
# ❌ Manual repomix execution without trigger
repomix  # Run unnecessarily on documentation changes

# ❌ Ignoring the automation
# Making technology changes but manually skipping repomix execution
```

### Trigger Pattern Examples

```
Technology File Changes → Auto Repomix
├── package.json modified → repomix
├── go.mod created → repomix
├── requirements.txt updated → repomix
├── Dockerfile added → repomix
└── Documentation changes → no trigger
```

# CC Cursor Rule Create Command Guidelines

## Description

The `cc_cursor_rule_create` command generates comprehensive, production-ready cursor rules in proper MDC format with complete YAML frontmatter, structured content sections, and practical implementation guidance. This command operates as a systematic single-phase creation process that delivers cursor rule files matching exceptional precision and structural integrity expected from Senior+ technical writers with 7+ years documentation experience.

**Command Version**: 1.2.0 - Enhanced with extended thinking integration, XML structuring framework, evidence verification protocols, and chain-of-thought reasoning validation.

## Rule

When using the `cc_cursor_rule_create` command, you MUST adhere to these directives:

1. **Mandatory Prefix Compliance**: Always begin responses with "**Mr. Alex 🤖, (v7.1)**" as specified in the core mandate.

2. **TodoWrite Integration Requirements**: 
   - Create structured todo lists before command execution using the TodoWrite tool
   - Track progress systematically through all 14 mandatory checklist items
   - Mark items as completed only after verification
   - Maintain visual progress indicators throughout execution

3. **Extended Thinking Protocol**:
   - Use `think hard` keyword for complex cursor rule creation (16K+ tokens allocation)
   - Apply systematic problem decomposition with clear logical progression
   - Evaluate minimum 2-3 alternative approaches with pros/cons analysis
   - Include confidence scoring (High: 90-100%, Medium: 70-89%, Low: 50-69%)

4. **File Creation Protocol**:
   - MUST create physical `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directory using Write tool
   - Follow kebab-case naming convention: `[rule-name].mdc`
   - Validate directory structure exists before file creation
   - Never display content only in terminal - generate actual files

5. **YAML Frontmatter Specifications**:
   - Include `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields
   - Use proper glob patterns: `["*.ts", "*.js"]` for multiple patterns, `""` for global
   - Apply appropriate globs based on rule target scope
   - Validate YAML syntax compliance

6. **Content Structure Requirements**:
   - Description: Clear explanation of rule purpose and scope
   - Rule: Numbered, actionable directives with specific requirements
   - Implementation: Technical details about cursor IDE enforcement
   - Benefits: Organizational and workflow advantages
   - Examples: Both correct (✅) and incorrect (❌) patterns with ASCII diagrams

7. **File/Directory Reference Validation**:
   - Verify all referenced paths exist using Read or LS tools
   - Correct non-existent paths or mark as creation requirements
   - Use relative paths only (e.g., `src/components/` not `/absolute/path/`)
   - Document path corrections in rule content

8. **Rule Conciseness & Completeness**:
   - Ensure rules are self-contained with full context
   - Eliminate verbose explanations while preserving functionality
   - Use direct, imperative language (e.g., "Execute repomix" not "Consider running...")
   - Maintain actionability when piped into other rules

9. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
   - Support all technical claims with verifiable evidence
   - Include confidence levels for recommendations
   - Reference specific documentation sources
   - Validate logical consistency throughout rule content

10. **Quality Assurance Gates**:
    - Validate final file format and syntax
    - Confirm all mandatory sections present
    - Verify markdown formatting compliance
    - Check structural integrity against reference standards

## Implementation

The cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:

- **Real-time Validation**: Checking command execution against the 10 mandatory directives
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring TodoWrite tool usage and checklist completion
- **File Creation Verification**: Ensuring physical `.mdc` files are generated in correct location
- **Format Compliance**: Validating YAML frontmatter syntax and MDC structure
- **Content Quality**: Comparing output against reference example standards

- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple verification gates prevent substandard output

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Command Usage

```bash
# Proper command execution with TodoWrite integration
/cc_cursor_rule_create api-validation "Ensure API calls include validation"

# Expected workflow:
1. Create TodoWrite checklist with 14 items
2. Use extended thinking with confidence scoring
3. Generate physical .mdc file in .cursor/rules/
4. Validate all file references exist
5. Ensure rule is self-contained and concise

# Cursor Rules Editing Standards

## Description

This rule enforces structural consistency and metadata preservation when editing or modifying existing cursor rules. It ensures that all modifications maintain MDC format compliance, preserve YAML frontmatter integrity, and uphold content quality standards established during rule creation. For initial rule creation standards, see [cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc](cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc).

## Rule

Preserve structure when editing cursor rules:

1. **Preserve YAML**: Never remove `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` fields
2. **Maintain Sections**: Keep Description → Rule → Implementation → Benefits → Examples order
3. **Validate Changes**: Check YAML syntax and markdown formatting before saving
4. **Verify Links**: Ensure cross-references to other rules remain functional
5. **Test Globs**: Confirm glob patterns still target intended files

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Global application (`alwaysApply: true`) ensures continuous enforcement during all cursor rule editing operations
- Real-time validation prevents structural corruption during modification
- Contextual warnings when required sections are removed or modified
- Automatic syntax checking for YAML frontmatter and markdown content

**AI Behavior Guidance:**
- Enforces preservation of established rule structure during all modification tasks
- Prevents accidental removal of metadata or required content sections
- Validates that edits maintain consistency with established cursor rule standards
- Ensures modifications enhance rather than degrade rule quality and effectiveness

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Pre-save validation hooks that check structural integrity
- YAML frontmatter protection against accidental deletion or corruption
- Cross-reference validation to prevent broken links between rules
- Content quality checks that apply creation standards to modifications

## Benefits

1. **Structural Integrity**: Prevents corruption of cursor rule structure during editing operations
2. **Metadata Protection**: Safeguards critical YAML frontmatter from accidental removal or damage
3. **Quality Consistency**: Ensures modifications maintain the same high standards as initial creation
4. **Cross-Reference Stability**: Preserves links and relationships between related cursor rules
5. **Change Validation**: Provides systematic verification that edits improve rather than degrade rule effectiveness
6. **Audit Compliance**: Maintains proper documentation and tracking of all rule modifications

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Editing Approach

**Proper Modification Workflow:**

```
BEFORE EDITING:
- Verify YAML frontmatter intact
- Confirm all sections present  
- Check cross-reference links

DURING EDITING:
- Preserve required YAML fields
- Maintain section structure
- Keep cross-references functional

AFTER EDITING:
- Validate YAML syntax
- Verify section completeness
- Test cross-reference links
```

### ❌ Incorrect Editing Patterns

**Destructive Modification Examples:**

```markdown
# ❌ METADATA CORRUPTION:
# Before:
---
description: "Enforce coding standards"
globs: ["**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# After (WRONG):
description: "Updated standards"  # ❌ Missing YAML delimiters
globs: **/*.ts  # ❌ Invalid YAML syntax
# ❌ Missing alwaysApply field

# ❌ STRUCTURAL DAMAGE:
# Original sections: Description, Rule, Implementation, Benefits, Examples
# Modified (WRONG): Description, Rule, Benefits  # ❌ Missing Implementation and Examples

# ❌ CONTENT DEGRADATION:
# Original: "Execute systematic validation with specific criteria"
# Modified (WRONG): "Do validation stuff"  # ❌ Vague language introduced

# ❌ BROKEN CROSS-REFERENCES:
# Original: [cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc](cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc)
# Modified (WRONG): [creation standards](creation-standards.mdc)  # ❌ Broken link
```

# Task Breakdown Enforcement Rule

## Description

This rule ensures Cursor systematically breaks down complex tasks into manageable components using TodoLists or integrated TaskLists. When any action requires multiple steps or can be divided into subtasks, Cursor must create and maintain structured task lists to prevent errors, ensure completeness, and improve development workflow quality.

## Rule

1. **Multi-Step Detection**: Identify tasks requiring multiple sequential actions or those divisible into logical components (e.g., feature implementation, debugging, refactoring, file modifications across multiple locations).

2. **Mandatory TodoList Creation**: For tasks with 2+ steps, immediately create a structured TodoList using available task management tools before proceeding with implementation.

3. **Task Granularity**: Break tasks into specific, actionable items with clear completion criteria. Each item must be independently verifiable and executable.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Mark completed items immediately upon completion. Maintain visual progress indicators throughout task execution.

5. **Error Prevention Protocol**: Before marking any task complete, verify all dependencies and prerequisites are satisfied. Include validation steps in task lists.

6. **Documentation Integration**: Embed TodoLists directly in relevant code comments, documentation, or use integrated task management systems to maintain context.

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will:
- Automatically detect complex tasks during analysis phase
- Prompt for TodoList creation when multi-step operations are identified
- Provide structured templates for common task breakdown patterns
- Integrate with existing task management tools and workflows
- Validate task completion before proceeding to dependent operations
- Maintain task history for workflow improvement and pattern recognition

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Systematic Task Breakdown

```
Task: Implement user authentication feature

TodoList:
☐ 1. Design authentication data models
☐ 2. Create user registration endpoint
☐ 3. Implement login validation logic
☐ 4. Add password hashing utilities
☐ 5. Create JWT token management
☐ 6. Build authentication middleware
☐ 7. Add route protection mechanisms
☐ 8. Write comprehensive unit tests
☐ 9. Update API documentation
☐ 10. Validate security compliance
```

### ✅ Correct: Debugging with Structured Approach

```
Issue: API endpoint returning 500 errors

Diagnostic TodoList:
☐ 1. Reproduce error consistently
☐ 2. Check server logs for stack traces
☐ 3. Validate input parameters
☐ 4. Test database connection
☐ 5. Verify environment variables
☐ 6. Review recent code changes
☐ 7. Implement fix
☐ 8. Test fix thoroughly
☐ 9. Deploy to staging
☐ 10. Monitor production logs
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Ad-Hoc Implementation

```
Task: Fix the authentication bug

Action: Jump directly into modifying authentication.js without:
- Understanding the specific issue
- Creating a systematic approach
- Planning verification steps
- Considering dependencies or side effects
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Incomplete Task Breakdown

```
TodoList:
☐ Fix auth
☐ Test it
☐ Deploy

Problems:
- Tasks too vague and non-actionable
- Missing critical steps
- No validation criteria
- Insufficient granularity for error prevention
```

### Visual Task Organization

```
Project Structure with Task Management:

src/
├── components/
│   ├── auth/           ← TodoList: Authentication components
│   │   ☐ LoginForm.tsx
│   │   ☐ RegisterForm.tsx
│   │   ☐ AuthGuard.tsx
│   └── common/         ← TodoList: Shared components
├── services/
│   └── api/            ← TodoList: API integration

# Documentation Markdown Formatting Standards

## Description

This cursor rule enforces comprehensive markdown formatting standards to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation across all markdown files. The rule combines industry-standard markdownlint best practices with specific CLAUDE.md compliance guidelines to create maintainable, readable, and properly structured documentation.

**Primary Focus Areas:**
- Code block language specification requirements
- Header hierarchy and formatting standards
- Spacing and indentation consistency
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md style guidelines

## Rule

**MANDATORY FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Code Block Language Specification**
   - Replace generic ``` with ```markdown or specific language identifier
   - Always specify language for fenced code blocks: ```javascript, ```bash, ```python, etc.
   - Use ```markdown for markdown content examples
   - Use ```text for plain text examples

2. **Header Hierarchy Standards**
   - Use proper markdown headers (#, ##, ###) following logical semantic hierarchy
   - Headers MUST start at line beginning with no leading whitespace
   - Follow consistent header level progression (don't skip levels)

3. **Header Formatting Compliance**
   - NEVER use **bold** or *italic* formatting for headers
   - Headers must use hash symbols (#) not underline formatting
   - Single space required between hash symbols and header text

4. **Spacing Requirements**
   - Include blank line between headers and content
   - Include blank line before code blocks
   - Include blank line after code blocks (except when ending file)
   - No multiple consecutive blank lines (maximum one blank line)

5. **Code Block Indentation**
   - Ensure correct indentation when code blocks are nested in lists
   - Maintain consistent indentation levels
   - Use spaces for indentation, not tabs

6. **List and Code Block Integration**
   - Proper spacing around fenced code blocks within lists
   - Maintain list context when including code examples
   - Preserve list item continuation for multi-paragraph items

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**

- Automatically suggests language identifiers when typing ```
- Highlights violations of header formatting standards
- Provides real-time feedback on spacing requirements
- Auto-corrects common formatting inconsistencies
- Integrates with markdown preview for immediate validation

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Code Block Formatting

```markdown
# Proper Header

This is content with proper spacing.

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Language specified correctly");
}
```

More content here.

## Subheader

- List item

  ```bash
  echo "Properly indented in list"
  ```

- Another item
```

### ❌ Incorrect Code Block Formatting

```markdown
#No space after hash

**This should be a header**

Content without spacing.
```
function badExample() {
  console.log("No language specified");
}
```
More content immediately after.

###Skipped header level

- List item
```bash
echo "Improper indentation"
```
```

### File Structure Requirements

```
project/
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md          ✅ Follows standards
│   ├── api-guide.md       ✅ Language-specified blocks
│   └── old-docs.md        ❌ Needs formatting update
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       └── docs-markdown-formatting.mdc
└── CLAUDE.md              ✅ Source of standards
```

### Common Violations and Fixes

**Generic Code Blocks:**
```markdown
❌ ```
   code without language
   ```

✅ ```text
   code with language specified
   ```
```

**Header Violations:**
```markdown
❌ **Important Section**
❌   # Indented Header
❌ ###Skipped Level

✅ # Important Section
✅ ## Proper Subsection
✅ ### Logical Progression
```

**Spacing Issues:**
```markdown
❌ # Header
Content immediately following

❌ Text before code
```python
code_without_spacing()
```

✅ # Header

Content with proper spacing

```python
code_with_proper_spacing()
```
```

# Documentation Markdown Metadata Standards

## Description

This rule enforces comprehensive YAML frontmatter metadata for all markdown files within the `docs/` directory, including specifications, templates, guides, and reference materials. The standardized metadata structure enhances document discoverability, enables automated processing, and provides essential context for both human readers and AI systems.

## Rule

All markdown files in the `docs/` directory **MUST** include properly formatted YAML frontmatter with the following required fields:

1. **title**: Clear, descriptive document title (string, required)
2. **description**: Concise summary of document content and purpose (string, required)  
3. **version**: Semantic version number for document tracking (string, required)
4. **status**: Document maturity level (string, required) - valid values: `draft`, `review`, `stable`, `deprecated`
5. **category**: Document classification for organization (string, required) - examples: `overview`, `guide`, `reference`, `spec`, `template`
6. **updated**: ISO 8601 date of last modification (string, required) - format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
7. **authors**: List of document contributors (array, required) - minimum one author
8. **related**: Cross-references to related documentation (array, optional) - relative paths to other docs

### Frontmatter Structure Requirements

- YAML frontmatter must be enclosed by triple dashes (`---`) at the beginning and end
- Must be the first content in the file (no preceding content allowed)
- Use spaces for indentation (tabs not permitted)
- All string values containing special characters must be quoted
- Arrays must use YAML list format with hyphens

### File Path Validation

- All paths in the `related` field must use relative references from the docs/ directory
- Cross-directory references must use proper relative path syntax (e.g., `../category/file.md`)
- File extensions must be included in all references

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- File pattern matching targets all markdown files within `docs/` directory structure
- Global application (`alwaysApply: true`) ensures continuous enforcement across documentation
- Real-time validation prevents incomplete metadata from being saved
- Contextual suggestions based on document type and existing metadata patterns

**Technical Enforcement:**
1. **File Creation**: New markdown files in `docs/` trigger metadata template insertion
2. **File Editing**: Missing or malformed frontmatter generates warnings
3. **Content Review**: Incomplete metadata fields highlighted during editing
4. **Reference Validation**: Broken or invalid `related` file paths flagged

**Automated Workflow Integration:**
- Template generation for required frontmatter fields
- Auto-population of `updated` field with current date
- Validation of `status` and `category` enum values
- Relative path completion for `related` field references

## Benefits

### Content Organization
- **Systematic Classification**: Consistent categorization enables efficient content discovery
- **Version Tracking**: Document versioning supports change management and rollback capabilities
- **Status Awareness**: Clear maturity indicators guide appropriate document usage

### Discoverability Enhancement  
- **Search Optimization**: Structured metadata improves search accuracy and filtering
- **Content Relationships**: Cross-references create navigable documentation networks
- **LLM Context**: Rich metadata provides essential context for AI-powered documentation tools

### Maintenance Efficiency
- **Update Tracking**: Timestamp metadata enables freshness monitoring and maintenance scheduling
- **Responsibility Clarity**: Author attribution establishes ownership and contact points
- **Automation Support**: Standardized structure enables automated validation and processing

# Justfile as Main Task Executor

## Description

This rule enforces the use of the Justfile as the central command runner and primary task executor for all development operations. Rather than running tools and commands directly, developers should define and execute tasks through the `just` command runner, ensuring consistency, discoverability, and maintainability across the development workflow.

## Rule

1. **Primary Task Execution**: Use `just [recipe]` commands instead of direct tool invocations (e.g., `just test` instead of `npm test`, `just build` instead of `make build`)

2. **Recipe Discovery**: Always run `just` or `just --list` to discover available tasks before executing commands

3. **New Task Definition**: When introducing new development operations, define them as recipes in the Justfile using:
   - Clear, descriptive recipe names following kebab-case convention
   - Proper shell configuration (`set shell := ["bash", "-uce"]` for error handling)
   - Environment variable loading (`set dotenv-load`) when needed
   - Appropriate dependencies between recipes

4. **Task Standardization**: Ensure all common development tasks are available through just recipes:
   - `just dev` for development server
   - `just test` for running tests  
   - `just build` for building the project
   - `just clean` for cleanup operations
   - `just lint` for code linting
   - `just format` for code formatting
   - `just deploy` for deployment operations

5. **Documentation Integration**: Include recipe descriptions using comments above each recipe and leverage `just --list` for task discovery

6. **Path References**: Use relative paths and project variables in recipes (e.g., `{{BUILD_DIR}}`, `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`)

7. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in recipes using shell flags and conditional logic

## Implementation

Cursor IDE enforces this rule by:

- **Command Suggestion**: When detecting direct tool commands (npm, yarn, make, cargo, etc.), suggest the corresponding `just` recipe equivalent
- **Recipe Validation**: Ensure new recipes follow proper Just syntax and conventions
- **Dependency Checking**: Verify recipe dependencies are correctly defined
- **Documentation Compliance**: Require recipe descriptions and maintain `just --list` discoverability
- **Path Validation**: Ensure all file and directory references in recipes use relative paths and exist in the project

## Benefits

- **Unified Interface**: Single entry point (`just`) for all development tasks
- **Self-Documenting**: `just --list` provides discoverable task documentation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Just handles shell differences across operating systems
- **Dependency Management**: Recipe dependencies ensure tasks run in correct order
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper environment variable loading and shell configuration
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: New team members can discover all available tasks easily
- **CI/CD Integration**: Consistent task interface between local development and CI/CD pipelines

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Using Just as Main Task Executor

```bash
# Discover available tasks
just
just --list

# Execute development tasks
just dev
just test
just build
just clean

# Execute tasks with parameters
just test unit
just deploy production
```

### ✅ Correct: Well-Structured Justfile Recipe

```just
# 🚀 Start development server with hot reload
dev:
    @echo "🚀 Starting development server..."
    @npm run dev || yarn dev || bun dev || deno task dev

# 🧪 Run test suite
test TEST="":
    @echo "🧪 Running tests{{if TEST != "" { " for " + TEST } else { "" }}}..."
    @if [ "{{TEST}}" != "" ]; then \
        npm test -- {{TEST}}; \
    else \
        npm test; \
    fi

# 🏗️ Build project for production
build: clean
    @echo "🏗️ Building for production..."
    @mkdir -p {{BUILD_DIR}}
    @npm run build
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Direct Tool Invocation

```bash
# Don't run tools directly
npm start
make build
cargo test
python -m pytest

# Don't use complex shell scripts without Just recipes
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force
bash -c "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Poorly Structured Justfile Recipe

```just
# Missing description and error handling
stuff:
    some-command
    another-command

# Hard-coded paths and no dependency management
bad:
    cd /absolute/path/to/project
    rm -rf /tmp/build
    make install
```

# Shell Script Compliance Rule

## Description

This rule enforces comprehensive shell script compliance by combining the project's ShellCheck configuration (`.shellcheckrc`) with Google Shell Style Guide standards. All shell scripts must pass ShellCheck validation and adhere to Google's formatting, naming, and coding conventions to ensure maintainability, security, and reliability.

## Rule

### 1. ShellCheck Configuration Compliance (MANDATORY)

1.1. **All shell scripts MUST pass ShellCheck validation** using the project's `.shellcheckrc` configuration:
   - Shell dialect: `bash` (as specified in `.shellcheckrc`)
   - Disabled warnings: SC2155, SC2250 (per project configuration)
   - Enabled checks: require-variable-braces, quote-safe-variables, check-unassigned-uppercase, deprecate-which
   - Severity level: warning minimum

1.2. **External sources handling** must follow project's `external-sources=true` setting

### 2. Google Shell Style Guide Compliance (MANDATORY)

2.1. **Shebang and File Header**:
   - Use `#!/bin/bash` for all executable shell scripts
   - Include descriptive file header comment explaining script purpose

2.2. **Function Definition and Structure**:
   - Use `function name() {` format (Google style with optional 'function' keyword)
   - Declare local variables with `local` keyword in functions
   - Use `readonly` for constants declared at file top

2.3. **Variable Handling and Quoting**:
   - Always quote variables: `"${variable}"` (required by shellcheck enable=require-variable-braces)
   - Use braces for all variable references: `${var}` not `$var`
   - Quote command substitutions: `"$(command)"`
   - Use arrays for lists: `declare -a FLAGS=(--foo --bar)`

2.4. **Error Handling and Exit Codes**:
   - Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
   - Check command return values explicitly: `if ! command; then`
   - Use `|| return 1` or proper error handling for function failures

2.5. **Control Flow and Formatting**:
   - Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` for conditionals
   - Use `(( ... ))` for arithmetic operations
   - Format loops: `for var in "${array[@]}"; do`
   - Use 2-space indentation (never tabs)

2.6. **Command and Tool Usage**:
   - Prefer bash built-ins over external commands
   - Use `command -v` instead of `which` (enforced by shellcheck enable=deprecate-which)
   - Avoid `eval` and other dangerous constructs

### 3. Project-Specific Requirements

3.1. **Script Location**: All shell scripts must be organized in the `scripts/` directory structure
3.2. **Configuration Reference**: Scripts must be compatible with `.shellcheckrc` settings
3.3. **Documentation**: Include function header comments for complex functions

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:

1. **Real-time ShellCheck Integration**:
   - Run shellcheck with project's `.shellcheckrc` configuration on save
   - Display inline errors and warnings for shellcheck violations
   - Highlight disabled rules (SC2155, SC2250) when encountered

2. **Style Guide Validation**:
   - Flag incorrect shebang lines (not `#!/bin/bash`)
   - Detect unquoted variables and suggest `"${var}"` format
   - Warn about missing `local` declarations in functions
   - Identify missing error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)

3. **Auto-completion and Suggestions**:
   - Suggest proper variable expansion syntax
   - Recommend bash built-ins over external commands
   - Provide templates for Google-style function headers

4. **File Organization**:
   - Monitor files matching globs: `**/*.sh`, `**/*.bash`, `**/scripts/**/*`
   - Validate script placement within `scripts/` directory structure

## Benefits

### Code Quality and Reliability
- **Prevents Common Errors**: ShellCheck catches 90% of bash scripting mistakes before runtime
- **Consistent Standards**: Google Shell Style Guide ensures uniform code across team
- **Production-Ready**: Enforces error handling and defensive programming practices

### Maintainability and Collaboration
- **Readable Code**: Consistent formatting and naming conventions improve code comprehension
- **Documented Functions**: Required function headers enable better code understanding
- **Standard Practices**: Team members can quickly understand and modify any script

### Security and Performance
- **Secure Defaults**: Proper quoting prevents injection vulnerabilities
- **Optimized Performance**: Preference for bash built-ins over external commands
- **Error Prevention**: Strict error handling (`set -euo pipefail`) prevents silent failures

### Development Workflow
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time feedback during development
- **Automated Validation**: Consistent checking without manual intervention  
- **Quick Fixes**: Cursor IDE can suggest and apply corrections automatically

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Git hook management utility following Google Shell Style Guide
# Compliant with project's .shellcheckrc configuration

# Strict error handling
set -euo pipefail

# Constants (readonly as per Google style)
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly CONFIG_FILE="${SCRIPT_DIR}/.shellcheckrc"

#######################################
# Install pre-commit hooks with validation
# Globals:
#   CONFIG_FILE
# Arguments:
#   None
# Returns:
#   0 if successful, 1 on error
#######################################
function install_hooks() {
    local hook_types=("pre-commit" "pre-push")
    
    for hook_type in "${hook_types[@]}"; do
        if ! install_single_hook "${hook_type}"; then
            echo "Failed to install ${hook_type} hook" >&2
            return 1
        fi
    done
    
    echo "All hooks installed successfully"
}

# Main execution (Google style)
function main() {
    local command="${1:-}"
    
    case "${command}" in
        install)
            install_hooks
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: $0 {install}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
}

# Execute main function if script is run directly
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main "$@"
fi
```

### ❌ Incorrect Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Wrong shebang - should be #!/bin/bash

# Missing error handling - no set -euo pipefail
# Missing file header comment

SCRIPT_DIR=`dirname $0`  # Wrong: backticks, unquoted variables
config_file=$SCRIPT_DIR/.shellcheckrc  # Wrong: no braces, no quotes

install_hooks() {  # Wrong: missing 'function' or () format
    # Missing local declaration
    hook_types="pre-commit pre-push"  # Wrong: string instead of array
    
    for hook_type in $hook_types; do  # Wrong: unquoted expansion
        install_single_hook $hook_type  # Wrong: unquoted variable
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # Wrong: [ instead of [[, checking $?
            echo "Failed to install $hook_type hook"  # Wrong: unquoted
            return 1
        fi
    done
    
    echo "All hooks installed successfully"
}

# Wrong: direct execution without main function
command=$1
case $command in  # Wrong: unquoted variables
    install)
        install_hooks
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {install}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

## File: docs/ai/04_ai_documentation/04.1_anthropic_prompt_engineering/anthropic-be-clear-direct-and-detailed.md
`````markdown
When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working. The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude's response will be.

## How to be clear, contextual, and specific

-   **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
    -   What the task results will be used for
    -   What audience the output is meant for
    -   What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
    -   The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
-   **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
-   **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

## Examples

### Example: Anonymizing customer feedback

Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer's name.

`````markdown
Extended thinking gives Claude 3.7 Sonnet enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while also providing transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.

## How extended thinking works

When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates `thinking` content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response.

The API response will include both `thinking` and `text` content blocks.

In multi-turn conversations, only thinking blocks associated with a tool use session or `assistant` turn in the last message position are visible to Claude and are billed as input tokens; thinking blocks associated with earlier `assistant` messages are [not visible](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#the-context-window-with-extended-thinking) to Claude during sampling and do not get billed as input tokens.

## Implementing extended thinking

Add the `thinking` parameter and a specified token budget to use for extended thinking to your API request.

The `budget_tokens` parameter determines the maximum number of tokens Claude is allowed use for its internal reasoning process. Larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis for complex problems, although Claude may not use the entire budget allocated, especially at ranges above 32K.

Your `budget_tokens` must always be less than the `max_tokens` specified.

The API response will include both thinking and text content blocks:

## Understanding thinking blocks

Thinking blocks represent Claude’s internal thought process. In order to allow Claude to work through problems with minimal internal restrictions while maintaining our safety standards and our stateless APIs, we have implemented the following:

-   Thinking blocks contain a `signature` field. This field holds a cryptographic token which verifies that the thinking block was generated by Claude, and is verified when thinking blocks are passed back to the API. When streaming responses, the signature is added via a `signature_delta` inside a `content_block_delta` event just before the `content_block_stop` event. It is only strictly necessary to send back thinking blocks when using [tool use with extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#preserving-thinking-blocks-during-tool-use). Otherwise you can omit thinking blocks from previous turns, or let the API strip them for you if you pass them back.
-   Occasionally Claude’s internal reasoning will be flagged by our safety systems. When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the `thinking` block and return it to you as a `redacted_thinking` block. These redacted thinking blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context.
-   `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks are returned before the `text` blocks in the response.

Here’s an example showing both normal and redacted thinking blocks:

When passing `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API in a multi-turn conversation, you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API for the last assistant turn.

This is critical for maintaining the model’s reasoning flow. We suggest always passing back all thinking blocks to the API. For more details, see the [Preserving thinking blocks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#preserving-thinking-blocks) section below.

### Suggestions for handling redacted thinking in production

When building customer-facing applications that use extended thinking:

-   Be aware that redacted thinking blocks contain encrypted content that isn’t human-readable
-   Consider providing a simple explanation like: “Some of Claude’s internal reasoning has been automatically encrypted for safety reasons. This doesn’t affect the quality of responses.”
-   If showing thinking blocks to users, you can filter out redacted blocks while preserving normal thinking blocks
-   Be transparent that using extended thinking features may occasionally result in some reasoning being encrypted
-   Implement appropriate error handling to gracefully manage redacted thinking without breaking your UI

## Streaming extended thinking

When streaming is enabled, you’ll receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events. Here’s how to handle streaming with thinking:

Example streaming output:

## Important considerations when using extended thinking

**Working with the thinking budget:** The minimum budget is 1,024 tokens. We suggest starting at the minimum and increasing the thinking budget incrementally to find the optimal range for Claude to perform well for your use case. Higher token counts may allow you to achieve more comprehensive and nuanced reasoning, but there may also be diminishing returns depending on the task.

-   The thinking budget is a target rather than a strict limit - actual token usage may vary based on the task.
-   Be prepared for potentially longer response times due to the additional processing required for the reasoning process.
-   Streaming is required when `max_tokens` is greater than 21,333.

**For thinking budgets above 32K:** We recommend using [batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) for workloads where the thinking budget is set above 32K to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.

**Thinking compatibility with other features:**

-   Thinking isn’t compatible with `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` modifications as well as [forced tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#forcing-tool-use).
-   You cannot pre-fill responses when thinking is enabled.
-   Changes to the thinking budget invalidate cached prompt prefixes that include messages. However, cached system prompts and tool definitions will continue to work when thinking parameters change.

### Pricing and token usage for extended thinking

Extended thinking tokens count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens. Since thinking tokens are treated as normal output tokens, they also count towards your rate limits. Be sure to account for this increased token usage when planning your API usage.

For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the pricing is:

| Token use | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Input tokens | $3 / MTok |
| Output tokens (including thinking tokens) | $15 / MTok |
| Prompt caching write | $3.75 / MTok |
| Prompt caching read | $0.30 / MTok |

[Batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) for extended thinking is available at 50% off these prices and often completes in less than 1 hour.

### Extended output capabilities (beta)

Claude 3.7 Sonnet can produce substantially longer responses than previous models with support for up to 128K output tokens (beta)—more than 15x longer than other Claude models. This expanded capability is particularly effective for extended thinking use cases involving complex reasoning, rich code generation, and comprehensive content creation.

This feature can be enabled by passing an `anthropic-beta` header of `output-128k-2025-02-19`.

When using extended thinking with longer outputs, you can allocate a larger thinking budget to support more thorough reasoning, while still having ample tokens available for the final response.

We suggest using streaming or batch mode with this extended output capability; for more details see our guidance on network reliability considerations for [long requests](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/errors#long-requests).

## Using extended thinking with prompt caching

Prompt caching with thinking has several important considerations:

**Thinking block inclusion in cached prompts**

-   Thinking is only included when generating an assistant turn and not meant to be cached.
-   Previous turn thinking blocks are ignored.
-   If thinking becomes disabled, any thinking content passed to the API is simply ignored.

**Cache invalidation rules**

-   Alterations to thinking parameters (enabling/disabling or budget changes) invalidate cache breakpoints set in messages.
-   System prompts and tools maintain caching even when thinking parameters change.

### Examples of prompt caching with extended thinking

## Max tokens and context window size with extended thinking

In older Claude models (prior to Claude 3.7 Sonnet), if the sum of prompt tokens and `max_tokens` exceeded the model’s context window, the system would automatically adjust `max_tokens` to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large `max_tokens` value and the system would silently reduce it as needed.

With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, `max_tokens` (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + `max_tokens` exceeds the context window size.

### How context window is calculated with extended thinking

When calculating context window usage with thinking enabled, there are some considerations to be aware of:

-   Thinking blocks from previous turns are stripped and not counted towards your context window
-   Current turn thinking counts towards your `max_tokens` limit for that turn

The diagram below demonstrates the specialized token management when extended thinking is enabled:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/context-window-thinking.svg)

The effective context window is calculated as:

We recommend using the [token counting API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting) to get accurate token counts for your specific use case, especially when working with multi-turn conversations that include thinking.

### Managing tokens with extended thinking

Given new context window and `max_tokens` behavior with extended thinking models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, you may need to:

-   More actively monitor and manage your token usage
-   Adjust `max_tokens` values as your prompt length changes
-   Potentially use the [token counting endpoints](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting) more frequently
-   Be aware that previous thinking blocks don’t accumulate in your context window

This change has been made to provide more predictable and transparent behavior, especially as maximum token limits have increased significantly.

When using extended thinking with tool use, be aware of the following behavior pattern:

1.  **First assistant turn**: When you send an initial user message, the assistant response will include thinking blocks followed by tool use requests.
    
2.  **Tool result turn**: When you pass the user message with tool result blocks, **the subsequent assistant message will not contain any additional thinking blocks.**
    

To expand here, the normal order of a tool use conversation with thinking follows these steps:

1.  User sends initial message
2.  Assistant responds with thinking blocks and tool requests
3.  User sends message with tool results
4.  Assistant responds with either more tool calls or just text (no thinking blocks in this response)
5.  If more tools are requested, repeat steps 3-4 until the conversation is complete

This design allows Claude to show its reasoning process before making tool requests, but not repeat the thinking process after receiving tool results. Claude will not output another thinking block until after the next non-`tool_result` `user` turn.

The diagram below illustrates the context window token management when combining extended thinking with tool use:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking and tool use](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/context-window-thinking-tools.svg)

### Preserving thinking blocks

During tool use, you must pass `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API. This is critical for maintaining the model’s reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

#### Why thinking blocks must be preserved

When Claude invokes tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, Claude will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving thinking blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

1.  **Reasoning continuity**: The thinking blocks capture Claude’s step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off.
    
2.  **Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they’re part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls.
    

**Important**: When providing `thinking` or `redacted_thinking` blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive `thinking` or `redacted_thinking` blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.

## Tips for making the best use of extended thinking mode

To get the most out of extended thinking:

1.  **Set appropriate budgets**: Start with larger thinking budgets (16,000+ tokens) for complex tasks and adjust based on your needs.
    
2.  **Experiment with thinking token budgets**: The model might perform differently at different max thinking budget settings. Increasing max thinking budget can make the model think better/harder, at the tradeoff of increased latency. For critical tasks, consider testing different budget settings to find the optimal balance between quality and performance.
    
3.  **You do not need to remove previous thinking blocks yourself**: The Anthropic API automatically ignores thinking blocks from previous turns and they are not included when calculating context usage.
    
4.  **Monitor token usage**: Keep track of thinking token usage to optimize costs and performance.
    
5.  **Use extended thinking for particularly complex tasks**: Enable thinking for tasks that benefit from step-by-step reasoning like math, coding, and analysis.
    
6.  **Account for extended response time**: Factor in that generating thinking blocks may increase overall response time.
    
7.  **Handle streaming appropriately**: When streaming, be prepared to handle both thinking and text content blocks as they arrive.
    
8.  **Prompt engineering**: Review our [extended thinking prompting tips](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips) if you want to maximize Claude’s thinking capabilities.

`````markdown
# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

## Examples

### Example: Self-correcting research summary

#### Prompt 1

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Summarize this medical research paper.<paper>{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}</paper>Focus on methodology, findings, and clinical implications. |
| Assistant{{SUMMARY}} | Methodology: Double-blind RCT with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received novel GLP-1/GIP dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received standard GLP-1 agonist. 24-week trial, primary endpoint: HbA1c reduction.

Findings:
- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction
- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction
- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%
- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss
- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss

Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, no serious events attributed to treatment.

Clinical Implications: Dual agonist shows superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard therapy. Could be a game-changer, especially for obese diabetics. |

#### Prompt 2

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Your task is to provide feedback on a research paper summary. Here is a summary of a medical research paper:<summary>{{SUMMARY}}</summary>Here is the research paper:<paper>{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}</paper>Review this summary for accuracy, clarity, and completeness on a graded A-F scale. |
| Assistant{{FEEDBACK}} | 1. Accuracy: A
- Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.
- Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.
- Assertion of "game-changer" is justified by significantly better outcomes.

2. Clarity: A-
- Concise and well-structured with clear sections.
- Good use of comparative language (e.g., "up 3% from Q1") for context.
- Minor issue: Acronyms like "RCT," "GLP-1," and "GIP" not defined. Consider spelling out first use.

3. Completeness: B+
- Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.
- Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).
- Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).
- Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.

Overall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies. |

#### Prompt 3

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Your task is to improve a paper summary given feedback. Here is the first draft of a medical research paper:<summary>{{SUMMARY}}</summary>Here is the research paper:<paper>{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}</paper>Here is the feedback:<feedback>{{FEEDBACK}}</feedback>Update the summary based on the feedback. |
| Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.

Findings:
- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction
- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction
- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%
- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss
- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss

Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.

Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.

Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

| ---- | ------- |
| User | As a senior solutions architect, review and analyze this multitenancy strategy for our new enterprise SaaS product.<strategy>{{STRATEGY}}</strategy>Focus on scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. |
| Assistant{{ANALYSIS}} | 1. Scalability:
+ Database sharding by tenant reduces contention, supports high growth.
+ Microservices allow independent scaling of components.
- Shared app servers could bottleneck under extreme load.
- No mention of auto-scaling or load balancing for app tier.

2. Security:
+ Tenant data isolation via sharding mitigates data leaks.
+ JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens is industry best practice.
- No mention of encryption (at rest, in transit) or key management.
- IAM strategy lacks detail on roles, permissions, or RBAC.

3. Cost-effectiveness:
+ Shared app servers reduce idle resource costs.
+ Serverless functions for infrequent tasks optimize costs.
- Per-tenant DB could increase costs at scale vs. optimized multi-tenant DB.
- No discussion of reserved instances or spot instances for cost saving. |

#### Prompt 2

| Assistant{{STRATEGY_DOC}} | # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product

## Executive Summary
The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Scalability: B+

Strengths:
- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.
- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.

Weaknesses:
- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.
- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.

### 2. Security: B-

Strengths:
- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.
- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.

Weaknesses:
- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.
- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?
- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).

### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B

Strengths:
- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.
- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.

Weaknesses:
- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.
- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.
- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.

## Recommendations

1. App Tier Resilience: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.

2. Security Hardening:
a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.
c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.

3. Cost Optimization:
a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.
b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.
c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.

4. Proof of Concept (PoC): Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:
a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.
b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.
c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.

With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

#### Prompt 3

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Grade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities.<priorities>{{PRIORITIES}}</priorities><strategy_doc>{{STRATEGY_DOC}}</strategy_doc> |
| Assistant | 1. Clarity: A
+ Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.
+ Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.
+ Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.
+ Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.

2. Actionability: A-
+ Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., "Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes").
+ PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.
+ Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.
+ Consider: Add a "Next Steps" section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.

3. Enterprise Alignment: A+
+ Directly addresses enterprise priorities:
- Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.
- Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.
- Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).
+ PoC with "high-scale simulation" and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.
+ Language resonates with enterprise concerns: "unacceptable risk," "enterprise-grade," "instill confidence."

Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a "Next Steps" section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |

# Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices

This guide provides specific prompt engineering techniques for Claude 4 models (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) to help you achieve optimal results in your applications. These models have been trained for more precise instruction following than previous generations of Claude models.

## General principles

### Be explicit with your instructions

Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. Being specific about your desired output can help enhance results. Customers who desire the "above and beyond" behavior from previous Claude models might need to more explicitly request these behaviors with Claude 4.

<Accordion title="Example: Creating an analytics dashboard">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation.
  ```
</Accordion>

### Add context to improve performance

Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4 better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.

<Accordion title="Example: Formatting preferences">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  NEVER use ellipses
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses since the text-to-speech engine will not know how to pronounce them.
  ```
</Accordion>

Claude is smart enough to generalize from the explanation.

### Be vigilant with examples & details

Claude 4 models pay attention to details and examples as part of instruction following. Ensure that your examples align with the behaviors you want to encourage and minimize behaviors you want to avoid.

## Guidance for specific situations

### Control the format of responses

There are a few ways that we have found to be particularly effective in steering output formatting in Claude 4 models:

1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**

   * Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"
   * Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."

2. **Use XML format indicators**

   * Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \<smoothly\_flowing\_prose\_paragraphs> tags."

3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**

   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, we recommend as best as you can matching your prompt style to your desired output style. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.

### Leverage thinking & interleaved thinking capabilities

Claude 4 offers thinking capabilities that can be especially helpful for tasks involving reflection after tool use or complex multi-step reasoning. You can guide its initial or interleaved thinking for better results.

```text Example prompt
After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
```

<Info>
  For more information on thinking capabilities, see [Extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Info>

### Optimize parallel tool calling

Claude 4 models excel at parallel tool execution. They have a high success rate in using parallel tool calling without any prompting to do so, but some minor prompting can boost this behavior to \~100% parallel tool use success rate. We have found this prompt to be most effective:

```text Sample prompt for agents
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
```

### Reduce file creation in agentic coding

Claude 4 models may sometimes create new files for testing and iteration purposes, particularly when working with code. This approach allows Claude to use files, especially python scripts, as a 'temporary scratchpad' before saving its final output. Using temporary files can improve outcomes particularly for agentic coding use cases.

If you'd prefer to minimize net new file creation, you can instruct Claude to clean up after itself:

```text Sample prompt
If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
```

### Enhance visual and frontend code generation

For frontend code generation, you can steer Claude 4 models to create complex, detailed, and interactive designs by providing explicit encouragement:

```text Sample prompt
Don't hold back. Give it your all.
```

You can also improve Claude's frontend performance in specific areas by providing additional modifiers and details on what to focus on:

* "Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible"
* "Add thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions"
* "Create an impressive demonstration showcasing web development capabilities"
* "Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement"

### Avoid focusing on passing tests and hard-coding

Frontier language models can sometimes focus too heavily on making tests pass at the expense of more general solutions. To prevent this behavior and ensure robust, generalizable solutions:

```text Sample prompt
Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.
```

## Migration considerations

When migrating from Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4:

1. **Be specific about desired behavior**: Consider describing exactly what you'd like to see in the output.

2. **Frame your instructions with modifiers**: Adding modifiers that encourage Claude to increase the quality and detail of its output can help better shape Claude's performance. For example, instead of "Create an analytics dashboard", use "Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."

3. **Request specific features explicitly**: Animations and interactive elements should be requested explicitly when desired.

# Extended thinking tips

This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of Claude's extended thinking feature. Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks. When you enable extended thinking, Claude shows its reasoning process before providing a final answer, giving you transparency into how it arrived at its conclusion.

See [Extended thinking models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models) for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking vs. standard thinking modes.

## Before diving in

This guide presumes that you have already decided to use extended thinking mode over standard mode and have reviewed our basic steps on [how to get started with extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#getting-started-with-claude-3-7-sonnet) as well as our [extended thinking implementation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).

### Technical considerations for extended thinking

- Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens. We recommend that you start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based on your needs and task complexity.
- For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that you use [batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
- Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in [any language Claude supports](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/multilingual-support).
- If you need thinking below the minimum budget, we recommend using standard mode, with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML tags (like `<thinking>`). See [chain of thought prompting](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).

## Prompting techniques for extended thinking

### Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions

Claude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model's creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.

For example, instead of:

```
User

Think through this math problem step by step: 
1. First, identify the variables
2. Then, set up the equation
3. Next, solve for x
...
```

Consider:

```
User

Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
```

That said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when needed. The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than previous versions. We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then read Claude's thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its thinking from there.

### Multishot prompting with extended thinking

[Multishot prompting](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) works well with extended thinking. When you provide Claude examples of how to think through problems, it will follow similar reasoning patterns within its extended thinking blocks.

You can include few-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by using XML tags like `<thinking>` or `<scratchpad>` to indicate canonical patterns of extended thinking in those examples.

Claude will generalize the pattern to the formal extended thinking process. However, it's possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best.

Example:

```
User

I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

<thinking>
To find 15% of 80:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
</thinking>

The answer is 12.

Now solve this one:
Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?
```

### Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking

Claude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is enabled. The model typically:

1. Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block
2. Executes those instructions in the response

To maximize instruction following:

- Be clear and specific about what you want
- For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude should work through methodically
- Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking

### Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior

You can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claude's logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.

To make the best use of this methodology, we recommend the following tips:

- We don't recommend passing Claude's extended thinking back in the user text block, as this doesn't improve performance and may actually degrade results.
- Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block is likely going to degrade results due to model confusion.

When extended thinking is turned off, standard `assistant` response text [prefill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response) is still allowed.

Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text. If you want a clean response, instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the answer.

### Making the best of long outputs and longform thinking

Claude with extended thinking enabled and [extended output capabilities (beta)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#extended-output-capabilities-beta) excels at generating large amounts of bulk data and longform text.

For dataset generation use cases, try prompts such as "Please create an extremely detailed table of…" for generating comprehensive datasets.

For use cases such as detailed content generation where you may want to generate longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses, try these tips:

- Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer outputs
- For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts down to the paragraph level. Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline and maintain the specified word counts

We do not recommend that you push Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens' sake. Rather, we encourage you to start with a small thinking budget and increase as needed to find the optimal settings for your use case.

Here are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:

#### Complex STEM problems

Complex STEM problems require Claude to build mental models, apply specialized knowledge, and work through sequential logical steps—processes that benefit from longer reasoning time.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, 
making sure to handle collision detection properly. 
Make the tesseract slowly rotate. 
Make sure the ball stays within the tesseract.
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, 
making sure to handle collision detection properly. 
Make the tesseract slowly rotate. 
Make sure the ball stays within the tesseract.
This complex 4D visualization challenge makes the best use of long extended thinking time as Claude works through the mathematical and programming complexity.
```

#### Constraint optimization problems

Constraint optimization challenges Claude to satisfy multiple competing requirements simultaneously, which is best accomplished when allowing for long extended thinking time so that the model can methodically address each constraint.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with the following constraints:
- Budget of $2,500
- Must include Tokyo and Kyoto
- Need to accommodate a vegetarian diet
- Preference for cultural experiences over shopping
- Must include one day of hiking
- No more than 2 hours of travel between locations per day
- Need free time each afternoon for calls back home
- Must avoid crowds where possible
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with the following constraints:
- Budget of $2,500
- Must include Tokyo and Kyoto
- Need to accommodate a vegetarian diet
- Preference for cultural experiences over shopping
- Must include one day of hiking
- No more than 2 hours of travel between locations per day
- Need free time each afternoon for calls back home
- Must avoid crowds where possible
With multiple constraints to balance, Claude will naturally perform best when given more space to think through how to satisfy all requirements optimally.
```

#### Thinking frameworks

Structured thinking frameworks give Claude an explicit methodology to follow, which may work best when Claude is given long extended thinking space to follow each step.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft entering 
the personalized medicine market by 2027.
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft entering 
the personalized medicine market by 2027.

Begin with:
1. A Blue Ocean Strategy canvas
2. Apply Porter's Five Forces to identify competitive pressures

Next, conduct a scenario planning exercise with four 
distinct futures based on regulatory and technological variables.

For each scenario:
- Develop strategic responses using the Ansoff Matrix

Finally, apply the Three Horizons framework to:
- Map the transition pathway
- Identify potential disruptive innovations at each stage
By specifying multiple analytical frameworks that must be applied sequentially, thinking time naturally increases as Claude works through each framework methodically.
```

### Have Claude reflect on and check its work for improved consistency and error handling

You can use simple natural language prompting to improve consistency and reduce errors:

1. Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
2. Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result
3. For coding tasks, ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking

Example:

```
User

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. 
Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:
- n=0
- n=1
- n=5
- n=10
And fix any issues you find.
```

# Keep Claude in character with role prompting and prefilling

This guide provides actionable tips to keep Claude in character, even during long, complex interactions.

* **Use system prompts to set the role:** Use system prompts to define Claude's role and personality. This sets a strong foundation for consistent responses.  
When setting up the character, provide detailed information about the personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks. This will help the model better emulate and generalize the character's traits.
* **Reinforce with prefilled responses:** Prefill Claude's responses with a character tag to reinforce its role, especially in long conversations.
* **Prepare Claude for possible scenarios:** Provide a list of common scenarios and expected responses in your prompts. This "trains" Claude to handle diverse situations without breaking character.

## Example: Enterprise chatbot for role prompting

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| System | You are AcmeBot, the enterprise-grade AI assistant for AcmeTechCo. Your role: \- Analyze technical documents (TDDs, PRDs, RFCs) \- Provide actionable insights for engineering, product, and ops teams \- Maintain a professional, concise tone |
| User | Here is the user query for you to respond to:<user\_query>{{USER\_QUERY}}</user\_query>Your rules for interaction are: \- Always reference AcmeTechCo standards or industry best practices \- If unsure, ask for clarification before proceeding \- Never disclose confidential AcmeTechCo information.As AcmeBot, you should handle situations along these guidelines: \- If asked about AcmeTechCo IP: "I cannot disclose TechCo's proprietary information." \- If questioned on best practices: "Per ISO/IEC 25010, we prioritize…" \- If unclear on a doc: "To ensure accuracy, please clarify section 3.2…" |

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.

---

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.  
   * Lacks guidance on _how_ to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think step-by-step before you write the email. |

* **Guided prompt**: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.  
   * Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the thinking.

Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think before you write the email. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email using your analysis. |

* **Structured prompt**: Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.

Example: Writing donor emails (structured guided CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think before you write the email in <thinking> tags. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email in <email> tags, using your analysis. |

### Examples

Example: Financial analysis without thinking

Without step-by-step thinking, Claude gives a recommendation that seems reasonable but lacks depth. It doesn't quantify the potential outcomes or consider historical market performance, which are crucial for making an informed decision.

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? |
| Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |

Example: Financial analysis with thinking

With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step. |
| Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<thinking>1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:- Goal: Down payment for a house- Timeline: 5 years- Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.2. Analyze Option A (Stock):- Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)- Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)- Calculate potential 5-year return:- Best case (12% annually): $10,000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ $17,623.42- Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,0003. Analyze Option B (Bond):- Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)- Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance- Calculate 5-year return:- Guaranteed: $10,000 * (1.06)^5 ≈ $13,382.254. Consider risk tolerance:- Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)- Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns- Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance5. Historical perspective:- Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed- In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:- 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&P 500 up ~82%- 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&P 500 down ~2%- Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term6. Final analysis:- Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal- Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet ~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds</thinking><answer>I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have $13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.</answer> |

# Long context prompting tips

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Claude's extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. This guide will help you leverage this power effectively.

## Essential tips for long context prompts

* **Put longform data at the top**: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.  
Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.

* **Structure document content and metadata with XML tags**: When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.  

Example multi-document structure  
```xml
<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
    <document_content>
      {{ANNUAL_REPORT}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
    <document_content>
      {{COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>
Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
```

* **Ground responses in quotes**: For long document tasks, ask Claude to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task. This helps Claude cut through the "noise" of the rest of the document's contents.  

Example quote extraction  
```xml
You are an AI physician's assistant. Your task is to help doctors diagnose possible patient illnesses.

<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>patient_symptoms.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT_SYMPTOMS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>patient_records.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT_RECORDS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="3">
    <source>patient01_appt_history.txt</source>
    <document_content>
      {{PATIENT01_APPOINTMENT_HISTORY}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>

Find quotes from the patient records and appointment history that are relevant to diagnosing the patient's reported symptoms. Place these in <quotes> tags. Then, based on these quotes, list all information that would help the doctor diagnose the patient's symptoms. Place your diagnostic information in <info> tags.

# Prefill Claude's response for greater output control

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Prefilling is only available for non-extended thinking modes. It's not currently supported with extended thinking.

When using Claude, you have the unique ability to guide its responses by prefilling the `Assistant` message. This powerful technique allows you to direct Claude's actions, skip preambles, enforce specific formats like JSON or XML, and even help Claude maintain character consistency in role-play scenarios.

In some cases where Claude is not performing as expected, a few prefilled sentences can vastly improve Claude's performance. A little prefilling goes a long way!

## How to prefill Claude's response

To prefill, include the desired initial text in the `Assistant` message (Claude's response will continue from where the `Assistant` message leaves off):

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favorite color?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI assistant, I don't have a favorite color, But if I had to pick, it would be green because"}  # Prefill here
    ]
)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Controlling output formatting and skipping the preamble

**Power user tip**: Prefilling `{` forces Claude to skip the preamble and directly output the JSON object. This is cleaner, more concise, and easier for programs to parse without additional processing.

#### Example: Structured data extraction without prefilling

### Example 2: Maintaining character in roleplay scenarios

**Role-play tip**: Prefilling a bracketed `[ROLE_NAME]` can remind Claude stay in character, even for longer and more complex conversations. This is especially powerful when combined with role prompting in the `system` parameter.

#### Example: Maintaining character without role prompting

| Role                                                          | Content                                                                                                                   |

| Assistant (Claude's response)                                 | Ah, what have we here? A most curious specimen, Watson! Let us examine this shoe with a discerning eye. The mud, you see, is not your common London clay, but rather the distinctive reddish hue of the iron-rich soil found only in the environs of Hampstead Heath. And yet, the wear on the sole suggests a gait more suited to the cobblestones of Whitechapel than the gentle slopes of the Heath.Now, observe the laces! They are tied with a particular knot favored by those in the medical profession—doubtless a habit acquired during years of tying surgical gowns. But the scuff marks on the toe box tell a different tale: they are consistent with the kicking motion one might employ in the martial arts, specifically Baritsu.We may conclude, then, that our absent shoe owner is a doctor, possibly a surgeon, who resides in Whitechapel but frequents Hampstead Heath—perhaps for a secret Baritsu practice, away from prying eyes. A most intriguing case, Watson! We must make haste; the game is afoot! |

# Reduce hallucinations

Even the most advanced language models, like Claude, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or inconsistent with the given context. This phenomenon, known as "hallucination," can undermine the reliability of your AI-driven solutions. This guide will explore techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure Claude's outputs are accurate and trustworthy.

## Basic hallucination minimization strategies

- **Allow Claude to say "I don't know":** Explicitly give Claude permission to admit uncertainty. This simple technique can drastically reduce false information.

    Example: Analyzing a merger & acquisition report

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | As our M&A advisor, analyze this report on the potential acquisition of AcmeCo by ExampleCorp.<report>{{REPORT}}</report>Focus on financial projections, integration risks, and regulatory hurdles. If you're unsure about any aspect or if the report lacks necessary information, say "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this." |

- **Use direct quotes for factual grounding:** For tasks involving long documents (>20K tokens), ask Claude to extract word-for-word quotes first before performing its task. This grounds its responses in the actual text, reducing hallucinations.

    Example: Auditing a data privacy policy

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | As our Data Protection Officer, review this updated privacy policy for GDPR and CCPA compliance.<policy>{{POLICY}}</policy>1. Extract exact quotes from the policy that are most relevant to GDPR and CCPA compliance. If you can't find relevant quotes, state "No relevant quotes found."2. Use the quotes to analyze the compliance of these policy sections, referencing the quotes by number. Only base your analysis on the extracted quotes. |

- **Verify with citations**: Make Claude's response auditable by having it cite quotes and sources for each of its claims. You can also have Claude verify each claim by finding a supporting quote after it generates a response. If it can't find a quote, it must retract the claim.

    Example: Drafting a press release on a product launch

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | Draft a press release for our new cybersecurity product, AcmeSecurity Pro, using only information from these product briefs and market reports.<documents>{{DOCUMENTS}}</documents>After drafting, review each claim in your press release. For each claim, find a direct quote from the documents that supports it. If you can't find a supporting quote for a claim, remove that claim from the press release and mark where it was removed with empty [] brackets. |

## Advanced techniques

- **Chain-of-thought verification**: Ask Claude to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.

- **Best-of-N verification**: Run Claude through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.

- **Iterative refinement**: Use Claude's outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.

- **External knowledge restriction**: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.

**Remember**, while these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, they don't eliminate them entirely. Always validate critical information, especially for high-stakes decisions.

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs. This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.

## Why use examples?

* **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
* **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
* **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

* **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
* **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
* **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.

## Example: Analyzing customer feedback

Notice that in the "no examples" version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.

| Role | No Examples | With Examples |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User | Analyze this customer feedback and categorize the issues. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low).Here is the feedback: {{FEEDBACK}} | Our CS team is overwhelmed with unstructured feedback. Your task is to analyze feedback and categorize issues for our product and engineering teams. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low). Here is an example:<example>Input: The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!Category: UI/UX, PerformanceSentiment: NegativePriority: High</example>Now, analyze this feedback: {{FEEDBACK}} |
| Assistant (Claude's response) | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:Issue: UI/UXSentiment: NegativePriority: HighThe customer is frustrated with the new dashboard design, which they find cluttered and slow to load. They specifically call out the missing "export" button, which is likely a critical feature. This issue needs to be addressed as a high priority.Issue: IntegrationSentiment: PositivePriority: MediumThe customer is pleased with the existing Salesforce integration but would like to see support for Hubspot as well. This is a feature request that could be considered for a future product update.Issue: PricingSentiment: NegativePriority: HighThe customer finds the pricing to be unreasonable, especially for the basic features. They are threatening to switch to a competitor, so this is a high-priority issue that needs to be reviewed.Issue: PerformanceSentiment NegativePriority: HighThe customer is experiencing critical issues with the mobile app, where large file uploads consistently result in crashes. This is a significant problem that impacts the customer's ability to use the product effectively and should be addressed as a high priority.Issue: UI/UXSentiment: PositivePriority: LowThe customer is overall satisfied with the product, specifically calling out the intuitive UI and excellent customer support. This is a positive piece of feedback that does not require any immediate action. | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:1\. The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!Category: UI/UX, PerformanceSentiment: NegativePriority: High2\. Love the Salesforce integration!

# Use XML tags to structure your prompts

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

## Why use XML tags?

* **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
* **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
* **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
* **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.

## Tagging best practices

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2. **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.

## Examples

### Example: Generating financial reports

Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn't match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.

| Role      | No XML Tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | With XML Tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Example: Legal contract analysis

Without XML tags, Claude's analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on.

| Assistant | The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. | <findings>1\. Indemnification (Clause 8): \- Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use. \- Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor's negligence or product defects. \- Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.2\. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9): \- Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages. \- Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions. \- Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.3\. IP Ownership (Clause 12): \- Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations. \- Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights. \- Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.4\. Unusual Terms: \- Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for "any purpose." \- Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for "convenience" with only 7 days' notice. \- Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.</findings><recommendations>1\. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.2\. Counter-propose: \- Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement. \- Liability: Cap at 12 months' fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect. \- IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations. \- Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only. \- Termination: Minimum 90 days' notice; only for cause. \- Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.3\. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions.4\. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes.</recommendations> |

# Troubleshooting

> Discover solutions to common issues with Claude Code installation and usage.

## Common installation issues

### Linux permission issues

When installing Claude Code with npm, you may encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (eg. `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Create a user-writable npm prefix

The safest approach is to configure npm to use a directory within your home folder:

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
```

This solution is recommended because it:

- Avoids modifying system directory permissions
- Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
- Follows security best practices

#### System Recovery: If you have run commands that change ownership and permissions of system files or similar

If you've already run a command that changed system directory permissions (such as `sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) /usr && sudo chmod -R u+w /usr`) and your system is now broken (for example, if you see `sudo: /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set`), you'll need to perform recovery steps.

##### Ubuntu/Debian Recovery Method:

1. While rebooting, hold **SHIFT** to access the GRUB menu

2. Select "Advanced options for Ubuntu/Debian"

3. Choose the recovery mode option

4. Select "Drop to root shell prompt"

5. Remount the filesystem as writable:

   ```bash
   mount -o remount,rw /
   ```

6. Fix permissions:

   ```bash
   # Restore root ownership
   chown -R root:root /usr
   chmod -R 755 /usr

   # Ensure /usr/local is owned by your user for npm packages
   chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME /usr/local

   # Set setuid bit for critical binaries
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/passwd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/newgrp
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/gpasswd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chsh
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chfn

   # Fix sudo configuration
   chown root:root /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chmod 4755 /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chown root:root /etc/sudo.conf
   chmod 644 /etc/sudo.conf
   ```

7. Reinstall affected packages (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   # Save list of installed packages
   dpkg --get-selections > /tmp/installed_packages.txt

   # Reinstall them
   awk '{print $1}' /tmp/installed_packages.txt | xargs -r apt-get install --reinstall -y
   ```

8. Reboot:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

##### Alternative Live USB Recovery Method:

If the recovery mode doesn't work, you can use a live USB:

1. Boot from a live USB (Ubuntu, Debian, or any Linux distribution)

2. Find your system partition:

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

3. Mount your system partition:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt  # replace sdXY with your actual system partition
   ```

4. If you have a separate boot partition, mount it too:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot  # if needed
   ```

5. Chroot into your system:

   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo chroot /mnt

   # For Arch-based systems:
   sudo arch-chroot /mnt
   ```

6. Follow steps 6-8 from the Ubuntu/Debian recovery method above

After restoring your system, follow the recommended solution above to set up a user-writable npm prefix.

## Auto-updater issues

If Claude Code can't update automatically, it may be due to permission issues with your npm global prefix directory. Follow the [recommended solution](#recommended-solution-create-a-user-writable-npm-prefix) above to fix this.

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead, you can
set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` [environment variable](settings#environment-variables) to `1`

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### ESC key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the ESC key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Click the "Configure terminal keybindings" hyperlink next to "Override IDE Shortcuts"
3. Within the terminal keybindings, scroll down to "Switch focus to Editor" and delete that shortcut

This will allow the ESC key to properly function for canceling Claude Code operations instead of being captured by PyCharm's "Switch focus to Editor" action.

## Getting more help

If you're experiencing issues not covered here:

1. Use the `/bug` command within Claude Code to report problems directly to Anthropic
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) for known issues
3. Run `/doctor` to check the health of your Claude Code installation

# Identity and Access Management

> Learn how to configure user authentication, authorization, and access controls for Claude Code in your organization.

## Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of three ways:

- Anthropic API via the Anthropic Console
- Amazon Bedrock
- Google Vertex AI

### Anthropic API authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Anthropic API:**

1. Use your existing Anthropic Console account or create a new Anthropic Console account
2. You can add users through either method below:
   - Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   - [Set up SSO](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10280258-setting-up-single-sign-on-on-the-api-console)
3. When inviting users, they need one of the following roles:
   - "Claude Code" role means users can only create Claude Code API keys
   - "Developer" role means users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to complete these steps:
   - Accept the Console invite
   - [Check system requirements](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#system-requirements)
   - [Install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)
   - Login with Console account credentials

### Cloud provider authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Bedrock or Vertex:**

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock) or [Vertex docs](/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai)
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/en/docs/claude-code/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)

## Access control and permissions

We support fine-grained permissions so that you're able to specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do (e.g. run tests, run linter) and what it is not allowed to do (e.g. update cloud infrastructure). These permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.

### Permission system

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type         | Example              | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior               |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only         | File reads, LS, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |
| Bash Commands     | Shell execution      | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files     | Yes               | Until session end                             |

### Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

- **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without further manual approval.
- **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
- **Additional directories** extend Claude's file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
- **Default mode** controls Claude's permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval.

#### Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files):

| Mode                | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool         |
| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

- **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
- **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
- **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls. For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

**Bash**

- `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
- `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`
</Tip>

**Read & Edit**

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home directory, use `~/`.

- `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
- `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
- `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

**WebFetch**

- `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

- `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
- `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

### Enterprise managed policy settings

For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we support enterprise managed policy settings that take precedence over user and project settings. This allows system administrators to enforce security policies that users cannot override.

System administrators can deploy policies to:

- **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- **Linux and Windows (via WSL)**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

These policy files follow the same format as regular [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files) but cannot be overridden by user or project settings. This ensures consistent security policies across your organization.

### Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

### Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

## Credential management

Claude Code supports authentication via Claude.ai credentials, Anthropic API credentials, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth. On macOS, the API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored on encrypted macOS Keychain. Alternately, the setting [apiKeyHelper](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings) can be set to a shell script which returns an API key. By default, this helper is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response; specifying environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` defines a custom refresh interval.

> Learn how to configure user authentication, authorization, and access controls for Claude Code in your organization.

## Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of three ways:

- Anthropic API via the Anthropic Console
- Amazon Bedrock
- Google Vertex AI

### Anthropic API authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Anthropic API:**

1. Use your existing Anthropic Console account or create a new Anthropic Console account
2. You can add users through either method below:
   - Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   - [Set up SSO](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10280258-setting-up-single-sign-on-on-the-api-console)
3. When inviting users, they need one of the following roles:
   - "Claude Code" role means users can only create Claude Code API keys
   - "Developer" role means users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to complete these steps:
   - Accept the Console invite
   - [Check system requirements](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#system-requirements)
   - [Install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)
   - Login with Console account credentials

### Cloud provider authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Bedrock or Vertex:**

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock) or [Vertex docs](/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai)
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/en/docs/claude-code/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)

## Access control and permissions

We support fine-grained permissions so that you're able to specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do (e.g. run tests, run linter) and what it is not allowed to do (e.g. update cloud infrastructure). These permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.

### Permission system

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type         | Example              | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior               |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only         | File reads, LS, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |
| Bash Commands     | Shell execution      | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files     | Yes               | Until session end                             |

### Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

- **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without further manual approval.
- **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
- **Additional directories** extend Claude's file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
- **Default mode** controls Claude's permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval.

#### Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files):

| Mode                | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool         |
| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

# Manage costs effectively

> Learn how to track and optimize token usage and costs when using Claude Code.

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is \$6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below \$12 for 90% of users.

For team usage, Claude Code charges by API token consumption. On average, Claude Code costs \~\$50-60/developer per month with Sonnet 4 though there is large variance depending on how many instances users are running and whether they're using it in automation.

## Track your costs

- Use `/cost` to see current session usage
- **Anthropic Console users**:
  - Check [historical usage](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console) in the Anthropic Console (requires Admin or Billing role)
  - Set [workspace spend limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces) for the Claude Code workspace (requires Admin role)
- **Pro and Max plan users**: Usage is included in your subscription

## Managing costs for teams

When using Anthropic API, you can limit the total Claude Code workspace spend. To configure, [follow these instructions](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces). Admins can view cost and usage reporting by [following these instructions](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console).

On Bedrock and Vertex, Claude Code does not send metrics from your cloud. In order to get cost metrics, several large enterprises reported using [LiteLLM](/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex-proxies#litellm), which is an open-source tool that helps companies [track spend by key](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/virtual_keys#tracking-spend). This project is unaffiliated with Anthropic and we have not audited its security.

## Reduce token usage

- **Compact conversations:**
  - Claude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity
  - Toggle auto-compact: Run `/config` and navigate to "Auto-compact enabled"
  - Use `/compact` manually when context gets large
  - Add custom instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`
  - Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:

    ```markdown
    # Summary instructions

    When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes
    ```

- **Write specific queries:** Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning

- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into focused interactions

- **Clear history between tasks:** Use `/clear` to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:

- Size of codebase being analyzed
- Complexity of queries
- Number of files being searched or modified
- Length of conversation history
- Frequency of compacting conversations
- Background processes (haiku generation, conversation summarization)

## Background token usage

Claude Code uses tokens for some background functionality even when idle:

- **Haiku generation**: Small creative messages that appear while you type (approximately 1 cent per day)
- **Conversation summarization**: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the `claude --resume` feature
- **Command processing**: Some commands like `/cost` may generate requests to check status

These background processes consume a small amount of tokens (typically under \$0.04 per session) even without active interaction.

<Note>
  For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to
  establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<prefix>:<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<prefix>`       | Command scope (`project` for project-specific, `user` for personal) |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension)   |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                            |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/project:`

In the following example, we create the `/project:optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/user:`

In the following example, we create the `/user:security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories to create namespaced commands.

**Structure**: `<prefix>:<namespace>:<command>`

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/project:frontend:component`

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

For example:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /project:fix-issue 123
```

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### File format

Command files support:

- **Markdown format** (`.md` extension)
- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata:
  - `allowed-tools`: List of tools the command can use
  - `description`: Brief description of the command
- **Dynamic content** with bash commands (`!`) and file references (`@`)
- **Prompt instructions** as the main content

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

- An MCP server is connected and active
- The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
- The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

- Server and prompt names are normalized
- Spaces and special characters become underscores
- Names are lowercased for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

- View all configured MCP servers
- Check connection status
- Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
- Clear authentication tokens
- View available tools and prompts from each server

## Work with images

Suppose you need to work with images in your codebase, and you want Claude's help analyzing image content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an image to the conversation">
    You can use any of these methods:

    1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
    2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
    3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., "Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Claude to analyze the image">
    ```
    > What does this image show?
    ```

    ```
    > Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
    ```

    ```
    > Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use images for context">
    ```
    > Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
    ```

    ```
    > This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
    ```

  </Step>

## Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference a single file">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```

    This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a directory">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```

    This provides a directory listing with file information.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference MCP resources">
    ```
    > Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
    ```

    This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- File paths can be relative or absolute
- @ file references add CLAUDE.md in the file's directory and parent directories to context
- Directory references show file listings, not contents
- You can reference multiple files in a single message (e.g., "@file1.js and @file2.js")
  </Tip>

## Use extended thinking

Suppose you're working on complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, or planning multi-step implementations that require deep reasoning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide context and ask Claude to think">
    ```
    > I need to implement a new authentication system using OAuth2 for our API. Think deeply about the best approach for implementing this in our codebase.
    ```

    Claude will gather relevant information from your codebase and
    use extended thinking, which will be visible in the interface.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine the thinking with follow-up prompts">
    ```
    > think about potential security vulnerabilities in this approach
    ```

    ```
    > think harder about edge cases we should handle
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips to get the most value out of extended thinking:

Extended thinking is most valuable for complex tasks such as:

- Planning complex architectural changes
- Debugging intricate issues
- Creating implementation plans for new features
- Understanding complex codebases
- Evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches

The way you prompt for thinking results in varying levels of thinking depth:

- "think" triggers basic extended thinking
- intensifying phrases such as "think more", "think a lot", "think harder", or "think longer" triggers deeper thinking

For more extended thinking prompting tips, see [Extended thinking tips](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Tip>

<Note>
  Claude will display its thinking process as italic gray text above the
  response.
</Note>

## Resume previous conversations

Suppose you've been working on a task with Claude Code and need to continue where you left off in a later session.

Claude Code provides two options for resuming previous conversations:

- `--continue` to automatically continue the most recent conversation
- `--resume` to display a conversation picker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue the most recent conversation">
    ```bash
    claude --continue
    ```

    This immediately resumes your most recent conversation without any prompts.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue in non-interactive mode">
    ```bash
    claude --continue --print "Continue with my task"
    ```

    Use `--print` with `--continue` to resume the most recent conversation in non-interactive mode, perfect for scripts or automation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Show conversation picker">
    ```bash
    claude --resume
    ```

    This displays an interactive conversation selector showing:

    * Conversation start time
    * Initial prompt or conversation summary
    * Message count

    Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select a conversation.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Conversation history is stored locally on your machine
- Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation
- Use `--resume` when you need to select a specific past conversation
- When resuming, you'll see the entire conversation history before continuing
- The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

How it works:

1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact

Examples:

```bash
# Continue most recent conversation
claude --continue

# Continue most recent conversation with a specific prompt
claude --continue --print "Show me our progress"

# Show conversation picker
claude --resume

# Continue most recent conversation in non-interactive mode
claude --continue --print "Run the tests again"
```

</Tip>

## Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Git worktrees">
    Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
    repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
    directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
    more in the [official Git worktree
    documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new worktree">
    ```bash
    # Create a new worktree with a new branch
    git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

    # Or create a worktree with an existing branch
    git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
    ```

    This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude Code in each worktree">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your worktree
    cd ../project-feature-a

    # Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
    claude
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude in another worktree">
    ```bash
    cd ../project-bugfix
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your worktrees">
    ```bash
    # List all worktrees
    git worktree list

    # Remove a worktree when done
    git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
- Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
- All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
- For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
- Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
- Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project's setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
  _ JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
  _ Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers \* Other languages: Following your project's standard setup process
  </Tip>

## Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.

**Add Claude to your build script:**

```json
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
- Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
- Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification
  </Tip>

### Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.

**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
- Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
- Consider using --output-format for structured output
  </Tip>

### Control output format

Suppose you need Claude's output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use text format (default)">
    ```bash
    cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
    ```

    This outputs just Claude's plain text response (default behavior).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
    ```

    This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use streaming JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
    ```

    This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude's response
- Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
- Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn
  </Tip>

## Create custom slash commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks.

For more details, see the [Slash commands](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) reference page.

### Create project-specific commands

Suppose you want to create reusable slash commands for your project that all team members can use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your project">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your custom command in Claude Code">
    ```
    > /project:optimize
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Command names are derived from the filename (e.g., `optimize.md` becomes `/project:optimize`)
- You can organize commands in subdirectories (e.g., `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` becomes `/project:frontend:component`)
- Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository
- The Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked
  </Tip>

### Add command arguments with \$ARGUMENTS

Suppose you want to create flexible slash commands that can accept additional input from users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a command file with the $ARGUMENTS placeholder">
    ```bash
    echo "Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps: 1.
    Understand the issue described in the ticket 2. Locate the relevant code in
    our codebase 3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause 4. Add
    appropriate tests 5. Prepare a concise PR description" >
    .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the command with an issue number">
    In your Claude session, use the command with arguments.

    ```
    > /project:fix-issue 123
    ```

    This will replace \$ARGUMENTS with "123" in the prompt.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The \$ARGUMENTS placeholder is replaced with any text that follows the command
- You can position \$ARGUMENTS anywhere in your command template
- Other useful applications: generating test cases for specific functions, creating documentation for components, reviewing code in particular files, or translating content to specified languages
  </Tip>

### Create personal slash commands

Suppose you want to create personal slash commands that work across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your home folder">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" >
    ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your personal custom command">
    ```
    > /user:security-review
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Personal commands are prefixed with `/user:` instead of `/project:`
- Personal commands are only available to you and not shared with your team
- Personal commands work across all your projects
- You can use these for consistent workflows across different codebases
  </Tip>

[View repository →](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action)

## Setup

## Quick setup

The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

<Note>
  * You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
  * This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. If you're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai) section.
</Note>

## Manual setup

If the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:

1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
2. **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))
3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

<Tip>
  After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment!
</Tip>

## Example use cases

Claude Code GitHub Actions can help you with a variety of tasks. For complete working examples, see the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples).

### Turn issues into PRs

In an issue comment:

```
@claude implement this feature based on the issue description
```

Claude will analyze the issue, write the code, and create a PR for review.

### Get implementation help

In a PR comment:

```
@claude how should I implement user authentication for this endpoint?
```

Claude will analyze your code and provide specific implementation guidance.

### Fix bugs quickly

In an issue:

```yaml
@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component
```

Claude will locate the bug, implement a fix, and create a PR.

## Best practices

### CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.

### Security considerations

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys directly to your repository!
</Warning>

Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

- Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
- Limit action permissions to only what's necessary
- Review Claude's suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:

**GitHub Actions costs:**

- Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
- See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

- Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
- Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
- See [Claude's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

- Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Configure appropriate `max_turns` limits to prevent excessive iterations
- Set reasonable `timeout_minutes` to avoid runaway workflows
- Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## Configuration examples

For ready-to-use workflow configurations for different use cases, including:

- Basic workflow setup for issue and PR comments
- Automated code reviews on pull requests
- Custom implementations for specific needs

Visit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) in the Claude Code Action repository.

<Tip>
  The examples repository includes complete, tested workflows that you can copy directly into your `.github/workflows/` directory.
</Tip>

## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

#### For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)">
    For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:

    1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
    2. Fill in the basic information:
       * **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., "YourOrg Claude Assistant")
       * **Homepage URL**: Your organization's website or the repository URL
    3. Configure the app settings:
       * **Webhooks**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed for this integration)
    4. Set the required permissions:
       * **Repository permissions**:
         * Contents: Read & Write
         * Issues: Read & Write
         * Pull requests: Read & Write
    5. Click "Create GitHub App"
    6. After creation, click "Generate a private key" and save the downloaded `.pem` file
    7. Note your App ID from the app settings page
    8. Install the app to your repository:
       * From your app's settings page, click "Install App" in the left sidebar
       * Select your account or organization
       * Choose "Only select repositories" and select the specific repository
       * Click "Install"
    9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
       * Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
       * Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file
    10. Add the App ID as a secret:

    * Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App's ID

    <Note>
      This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.
    </Note>

    **Alternative for Anthropic API or if you don't want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:

    1. Install from: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
    2. No additional configuration needed for authentication

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure cloud provider authentication">
    Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="AWS Bedrock">
        **Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock**:
           * Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
           * For cross-region models, request access in all required regions

        2. **Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider**:
           * Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`

        3. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
           * Trusted entity type: Web identity
           * Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Permissions: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy
           * Configure trust policy for your specific repository

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **AWS\_ROLE\_TO\_ASSUME**: The ARN of the IAM role you created

        <Tip>
          OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.
        </Tip>

        See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for detailed OIDC setup instructions.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Google Vertex AI">
        **Configure Google Cloud to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable APIs** in your Google Cloud project:
           * IAM Credentials API
           * Security Token Service (STS) API
           * Vertex AI API

        2. **Create Workload Identity Federation resources**:
           * Create a Workload Identity Pool
           * Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
             * Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
             * Attribute mappings for repository and owner
             * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific attribute conditions

        3. **Create a Service Account**:
           * Grant only `Vertex AI User` role
           * **Security recommendation**: Create a dedicated service account per repository

        4. **Configure IAM bindings**:
           * Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
           * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific principal sets

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **GCP\_WORKLOAD\_IDENTITY\_PROVIDER**: The full provider resource name
        * **GCP\_SERVICE\_ACCOUNT**: The service account email address

        <Tip>
          Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.
        </Tip>

        For detailed setup instructions, consult the [Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### CI not running on Claude's commits

Ensure you're using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## Advanced configuration

### Action parameters

The Claude Code Action supports these key parameters:

| Parameter           | Description                    | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt`            | The prompt to send to Claude   | Yes\*    |
| `prompt_file`       | Path to file containing prompt | Yes\*    |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Anthropic API key              | Yes\*\*  |
| `max_turns`         | Maximum conversation turns     | No       |
| `timeout_minutes`   | Execution timeout              | No       |

\*Either `prompt` or `prompt_file` required\
\*\*Required for direct Anthropic API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

### Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

- **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
- **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
- **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for detailed documentation.

### Customizing Claude's behavior

You can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.

# Hooks

> Customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

# Introduction

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

Example use cases include:

- **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
- **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
- **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
- **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
- **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  Hooks execute shell commands with your full user permissions without
  confirmation. You are responsible for ensuring your hooks are safe and secure.
  Anthropic is not liable for any data loss or system damage resulting from hook
  usage. Review [Security Considerations](#security-considerations).
</Warning>

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

Quickstart Prerequisite: Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press Esc until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered!

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured in your
[settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings):

- `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
- `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
- Enterprise managed policy settings

### Structure

Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names (only applicable for `PreToolUse` and
  `PostToolUse`)
  - Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
  - Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
  - If omitted or empty string, hooks run for all matching events
- **hooks**: Array of commands to execute when the pattern matches
  - `type`: Currently only `"command"` is supported
  - `command`: The bash command to execute
  - `timeout`: (Optional) How long a command should run, in seconds, before
    canceling all in-progress hooks.

## Hook Events

### PreToolUse

Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.

**Common matchers:**

- `Task` - Agent tasks
- `Bash` - Shell commands
- `Glob` - File pattern matching
- `Grep` - Content search
- `Read` - File reading
- `Edit`, `MultiEdit` - File editing
- `Write` - File writing
- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

### PostToolUse

Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.

Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications.

### Stop

Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding.

### SubagentStop

Runs when a Claude Code subagent (Task tool call) has finished responding.

## Hook Input

Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
event-specific data:

```typescript
{
  // Common fields
  session_id: string
  transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON

  // Event-specific fields
  ...
}
```

### PreToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  }
}
```

### PostToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  },
  "tool_response": {
    "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Notification Input

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "message": "Task completed successfully",
  "title": "Claude Code"
}
```

### Stop and SubagentStop Input

`stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
from running indefinitely.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "stop_hook_active": true
}
```

## Hook Output

There are two ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
and the user.

### Simple: Exit Code

Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

- **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in transcript mode
  (CTRL-R).
- **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. `stderr` is fed back to Claude to process
  automatically. See per-hook-event behavior below.
- **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user and
  execution continues.

<Warning>
  Reminder: Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0.
</Warning>

#### Exit Code 2 Behavior

| Hook Event     | Behavior                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `PreToolUse`   | Blocks the tool call, shows error to Claude     |
| `PostToolUse`  | Shows error to Claude (tool already ran)        |
| `Notification` | N/A, shows stderr to user only                  |
| `Stop`         | Blocks stoppage, shows error to Claude          |
| `SubagentStop` | Blocks stoppage, shows error to Claude subagent |

### Advanced: JSON Output

Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control:

#### Common JSON Fields

All hook types can include these optional fields:

```json
{
  "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
  "stopReason": "string" // Message shown when continue is false
  "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
}
```

If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

- For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which only
  blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
- For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
  provides automated feedback to Claude.
- For `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, this takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.
- In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.

`stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
to Claude.

#### `PreToolUse` Decision Control

`PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

- "approve" bypasses the permission system. `reason` is shown to the user but
  not to Claude.
- "block" prevents the tool call from executing. `reason` is shown to Claude.
- `undefined` leads to the existing permission flow. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "approve" | "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `PostToolUse` Decision Control

`PostToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

- "block" automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
- `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `Stop`/`SubagentStop` Decision Control

`Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

- "block" prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
  to know how to proceed.
- `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

#### JSON Output Example: Bash Command Editing

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import re
import sys

# Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples
VALIDATION_RULES = [
    (
        r"\bgrep\b(?!.*\|)",
        "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
    ),
    (
        r"\bfind\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
        "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
    ),
]


def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
    issues = []
    for pattern, message in VALIDATION_RULES:
        if re.search(pattern, command):
            issues.append(message)
    return issues


try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
command = tool_input.get("command", "")

if tool_name != "Bash" or not command:
    sys.exit(1)

# Validate the command
issues = validate_command(command)

if issues:
    for message in issues:
        print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
    sys.exit(2)
```

## Working with MCP Tools

Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

### MCP Tool Naming

MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

- `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server's create entities tool
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server's read file tool
- `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server's search tool

### Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Code Formatting

Automatically format code after file modifications:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/format-code.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notification

Customize the notification that is sent when Claude Code requests permission or
when the prompt input has become idle.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/my_custom_notifier.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

- You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
- Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
- Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
- Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
  resulting from hook usage
- You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
configuration.

### Security Best Practices

Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts
5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

### Configuration Safety

Direct edits to hooks in settings files don't take effect immediately. Claude
Code:

1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

## Hook Execution Details

- **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
  - If any individual command times out, all in-progress hooks are cancelled.
- **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
- **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
- **Input**: JSON via stdin
- **Output**:
  - PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop: Progress shown in transcript (Ctrl-R)
  - Notification: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)

## Debugging

To troubleshoot hooks:

1. Check if `/hooks` menu displays your configuration
2. Verify that your [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings) are valid
   JSON
3. Test commands manually
4. Check exit codes
5. Review stdout and stderr format expectations
6. Ensure proper quote escaping
7. Use `claude --debug` to debug your hooks. The output of a successful hook
   appears like below.

```
[DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
[DEBUG] Getting matching hook commands for PostToolUse with query: Write
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook matchers in settings
[DEBUG] Matched 1 hooks for query "Write"
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
[DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 60000ms
[DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
```

Progress messages appear in transcript mode (Ctrl-R) showing:

- Which hook is running
- Command being executed
- Success/failure status
- Output or error messages

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. For more details about MCP, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

<Warning>
  Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP
  servers, and be especially careful when using MCP servers that talk to the
  internet, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
</Warning>

## Configure MCP servers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP stdio Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

    # Example: Adding a local server
    claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP SSE Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding an SSE server
    claude mcp add --transport sse sse-server https://example.com/sse-endpoint

    # Example: Adding an SSE server with custom headers
    claude mcp add --transport sse api-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "X-API-Key: your-key"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP HTTP Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding a streamable HTTP server
    claude mcp add --transport http http-server https://example.com/mcp

    # Example: Adding an HTTP server with authentication header
    claude mcp add --transport http secure-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your MCP servers">
    ```bash
    # List all configured servers
    claude mcp list

    # Get details for a specific server
    claude mcp get my-server

    # Remove a server
    claude mcp remove my-server
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use the `-s` or `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
  - `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
  - `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
  - `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `-e` or `--env` flags (e.g., `-e KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Check MCP server status any time using the `/mcp` command within Claude Code
- MCP follows a client-server architecture where Claude Code (the client) can connect to multiple specialized servers
- Claude Code supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) and streamable HTTP servers for real-time communication
- Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
  </Tip>

## Understanding MCP server scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn't be shared.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server -s local /path/to/server
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server -s project /path/to/server
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server -s user /path/to/server
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

- **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
- **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many remote MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for secure connection to these servers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a remote server requiring authentication">
    ```bash
    # Add an SSE or HTTP server that requires OAuth
    claude mcp add --transport sse github-server https://api.github.com/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate using the /mcp command">
    Within Claude Code, use the `/mcp` command to manage authentication:

    ```
    > /mcp
    ```

    This opens an interactive menu where you can:

    * View connection status for all servers
    * Authenticate with servers requiring OAuth
    * Clear existing authentication
    * View server capabilities

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the OAuth flow">
    When you select "Authenticate" for a server:

    1. Your browser opens automatically to the OAuth provider
    2. Complete the authentication in your browser
    3. Claude Code receives and securely stores the access token
    4. The server connection becomes active

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
- Use "Clear authentication" in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
- If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the provided URL
- OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports
  </Tip>

## Connect to a Postgres MCP server

Suppose you want to give Claude read-only access to a PostgreSQL database for querying and schema inspection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Postgres MCP server">
    ```bash
    claude mcp add postgres-server /path/to/postgres-mcp-server --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query your database with Claude">
    ```
    > describe the schema of our users table
    ```

    ```
    > what are the most recent orders in the system?
    ```

    ```
    > show me the relationship between customers and invoices
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The Postgres MCP server provides read-only access for safety
- Claude can help you explore database structure and run analytical queries
- You can use this to quickly understand database schemas in unfamiliar projects
- Make sure your connection string uses appropriate credentials with minimum required permissions
  </Tip>

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

Suppose you have a JSON configuration for a single MCP server that you want to add to Claude Code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP server from JSON">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

    # Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
    claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the server was added">
    ```bash
    claude mcp get weather-api
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
- The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
- You can use `-s global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one
  </Tip>

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

Suppose you have already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop and want to use the same servers in Claude Code without manually reconfiguring them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import servers from Claude Desktop">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select which servers to import">
    After running the command, you'll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the servers were imported">
    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
- Use the `-s global` flag to add servers to your global configuration
- Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
- If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., `server_1`)
  </Tip>

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

Suppose you want to use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to, providing them with Claude's tools and capabilities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Claude as an MCP server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp serve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect from another application">
    You can connect to Claude Code MCP server from any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop. If you're using Claude Desktop, you can add the Claude Code MCP server using this configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The server provides access to Claude's tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
- In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
- Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code's tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
  </Tip>

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="List available resources">
    Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a specific resource">
    Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

    ```
    > Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
    ```

    ```
    > Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Multiple resource references">
    You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

    ```
    > Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
- Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
- Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
- Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
  </Tip>

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover available prompts">
    Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt without arguments">
    ```
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt with arguments">
    Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

    ```
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    ```

    ```
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Arguments are parsed based on the prompt's defined parameters
- Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
- Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)

# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  | Use Case Examples                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows         |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts             |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences    | _(Deprecated, see below)_ Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory _/_ and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in _foo/bar/_, and have memories in both _foo/CLAUDE.md_ and _foo/bar/CLAUDE.md_.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands.

Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:

```
> /init
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
- Document code style preferences and naming conventions
- Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
- CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.
  </Tip>

## Memory best practices

- **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
- **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
- **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

# Monitoring

> Learn how to enable and configure OpenTelemetry for Claude Code.

Claude Code supports OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics and events for monitoring and observability.

All metrics are time series data exported via OpenTelemetry's standard metrics protocol, and events are exported via OpenTelemetry's logs/events protocol. It is the user's responsibility to ensure their metrics and logs backends are properly configured and that the aggregation granularity meets their monitoring requirements.

<Note>
  OpenTelemetry support is currently in beta and details are subject to change.
</Note>

## Quick Start

Configure OpenTelemetry using environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Enable telemetry
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# 2. Choose exporters (both are optional - configure only what you need)
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp       # Options: otlp, prometheus, console
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp          # Options: otlp, console

# 3. Configure OTLP endpoint (for OTLP exporter)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# 4. Set authentication (if required)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# 5. For debugging: reduce export intervals
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=10000  # 10 seconds (default: 60000ms)
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL=5000     # 5 seconds (default: 5000ms)

# 6. Run Claude Code
claude
```

<Note>
  The default export intervals are 60 seconds for metrics and 5 seconds for logs. During setup, you may want to use shorter intervals for debugging purposes. Remember to reset these for production use.
</Note>

For full configuration options, see the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#configuration-options).

## Administrator Configuration

Administrators can configure OpenTelemetry settings for all users through the managed settings file. This allows for centralized control of telemetry settings across an organization. See the [settings precedence](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-precedence) for more information about how settings are applied.

The managed settings file is located at:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- Linux: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

Example managed settings configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://collector.company.com:4317",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS": "Authorization=Bearer company-token"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Managed settings can be distributed via MDM (Mobile Device Management) or other device management solutions. Environment variables defined in the managed settings file have high precedence and cannot be overridden by users.
</Note>

## Configuration Details

### Common Configuration Variables

| Environment Variable                            | Description                                               | Example Values                       |

| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL`                   | Export interval in milliseconds (default: 60000)          | `5000`, `60000`                      |
| `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL`                     | Logs export interval in milliseconds (default: 5000)      | `1000`, `10000`                      |
| `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS`                         | Enable logging of user prompt content (default: disabled) | `1` to enable                        |

### Metrics Cardinality Control

The following environment variables control which attributes are included in metrics to manage cardinality:

| Environment Variable                | Description                                    | Default Value | Example to Disable |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID`   | Include session.id attribute in metrics        | `true`        | `false`            |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_VERSION`      | Include app.version attribute in metrics       | `false`       | `true`             |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ACCOUNT_UUID` | Include user.account_uuid attribute in metrics | `true`        | `false`            |

These variables help control the cardinality of metrics, which affects storage requirements and query performance in your metrics backend. Lower cardinality generally means better performance and lower storage costs but less granular data for analysis.

### Multi-Team Organization Support

Organizations with multiple teams or departments can add custom attributes to distinguish between different groups using the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable:

```bash
# Add custom attributes for team identification
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="department=engineering,team.id=platform,cost_center=eng-123"
```

These custom attributes will be included in all metrics and events, allowing you to:

- Filter metrics by team or department
- Track costs per cost center
- Create team-specific dashboards
- Set up alerts for specific teams

### Example Configurations

## Interpreting Metrics and Events Data

The metrics exported by Claude Code provide valuable insights into usage patterns and productivity. Here are some common visualizations and analyses you can create:

### Usage Monitoring

| Metric                                                        | Analysis Opportunity                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude_code.token.usage`                                     | Break down by `type` (input/output), user, team, or model |
| `claude_code.session.count`                                   | Track adoption and engagement over time                   |
| `claude_code.lines_of_code.count`                             | Measure productivity by tracking code additions/removals  |
| `claude_code.commit.count` & `claude_code.pull_request.count` | Understand impact on development workflows                |

### Cost Monitoring

The `claude_code.cost.usage` metric helps with:

- Tracking usage trends across teams or individuals
- Identifying high-usage sessions for optimization

<Note>
  Cost metrics are approximations. For official billing data, refer to your API provider (Anthropic Console, AWS Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex).
</Note>

### Alerting and Segmentation

Common alerts to consider:

- Cost spikes
- Unusual token consumption
- High session volume from specific users

All metrics can be segmented by `user.account_uuid`, `organization.id`, `session.id`, `model`, and `app.version`.

### Event Analysis

The event data provides detailed insights into Claude Code interactions:

**Tool Usage Patterns**: Analyze tool result events to identify:

- Most frequently used tools
- Tool success rates
- Average tool execution times
- Error patterns by tool type

**Performance Monitoring**: Track API request durations and tool execution times to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Backend Considerations

Your choice of metrics and logs backends will determine the types of analyses you can perform:

### For Metrics:

- **Time series databases (e.g., Prometheus)**: Rate calculations, aggregated metrics
- **Columnar stores (e.g., ClickHouse)**: Complex queries, unique user analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (e.g., Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Advanced querying, visualization, alerting

### For Events/Logs:

- **Log aggregation systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki)**: Full-text search, log analysis
- **Columnar stores (e.g., ClickHouse)**: Structured event analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (e.g., Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Correlation between metrics and events

For organizations requiring Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active User (DAU/WAU/MAU) metrics, consider backends that support efficient unique value queries.

## Service Information

All metrics are exported with:

- Service Name: `claude-code`
- Service Version: Current Claude Code version
- Meter Name: `com.anthropic.claude_code`

## Security/Privacy Considerations

- Telemetry is opt-in and requires explicit configuration
- Sensitive information like API keys or file contents are never included in metrics or events
- User prompt content is redacted by default - only prompt length is recorded. To enable user prompt logging, set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`

## Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting WSL installation

Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL.

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

- Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
- Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Optimize your terminal setup

Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

**Supported shells**:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

### Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That's handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code's theme to your terminal during onboarding or any time via the `/config` command

### Line breaks

You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code:

- **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper configuration

To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

**Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users**: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

### Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

#### Terminal bell notifications

Enable sound alerts when tasks complete:

```sh
claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell
```

**For macOS users**: Don't forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings → Notifications → \[Your Terminal App].

#### iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell" and Filter Alerts → "Send escape sequence-generated alerts"
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

#### Custom notification hooks

For advanced notification handling, you can create [notification hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#notification) to run your own logic.

### Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

- **Avoid direct pasting**: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
- **Use file-based workflows**: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
- **Be aware of VS Code limitations**: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

### Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:

- Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
- Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`
- Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)

# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- [Installed Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
- A terminal or command prompt open
- A code project to work with

## Step 1: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code prompt inside a new interactive session:

```
✻ Welcome to Claude Code!

...

> Try "create a util logging.py that..."
```

## Step 2: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```
> where is the main entry point?
```

```
> explain the folder structure
```

<Note>
  Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context.
</Note>

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

<Note>
  Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.
</Note>

## Step 4: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 5: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## Step 6: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:

**Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
</Tip>

# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

- **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
- **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  - `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
- For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise
  managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project
  settings. System administrators can deploy policies to
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and
  `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux and Windows via WSL.

```JSON Example settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

| Key                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Example                         |

### Settings precedence

Settings are applied in order of precedence:

1. Enterprise policies (see [IAM documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#enterprise-managed-policy-settings))
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

## Configuration options

We are in the process of migrating global configuration to `settings.json`.

`claude config` will be deprecated in place of [settings.json](#settings-files)

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

- List settings: `claude config list`
- See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
- Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
- Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
- Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default `config` changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

| Key                     | Description                                                      | Example                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoUpdates`           | Whether to enable automatic updates (default: `true`)            | `false`                                                                    |
| `preferredNotifChannel` | Where you want to receive notifications (default: `iterm2`)      | `iterm2`, `iterm2_with_bell`, `terminal_bell`, or `notifications_disabled` |
| `theme`                 | Color theme                                                      | `dark`, `light`, `light-daltonized`, or `dark-daltonized`                  |
| `verbose`               | Whether to show full bash and command outputs (default: `false`) | `true`                                                                     |

## Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

| Tool             | Description                                          | Permission Required |

| **MultiEdit**    | Performs multiple edits on a single file atomically  | Yes                 |
| **NotebookEdit** | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells                      | Yes                 |
| **NotebookRead** | Reads and displays Jupyter notebook contents         | No                  |
| **Read**         | Reads the contents of files                          | No                  |
| **TodoRead**     | Reads the current session's task list                | No                  |
| **TodoWrite**    | Creates and manages structured task lists            | No                  |
| **WebFetch**     | Fetches content from a specified URL                 | Yes                 |
| **WebSearch**    | Performs web searches with domain filtering          | Yes                 |
| **Write**        | Creates or overwrites files                          | Yes                 |

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings).

### Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.

### 2.3 Problem & Value Proposition

*This section is critical for context engineering. The AI will refine your input, but the core problem and solution must come from you.*

**The Problem We Are Solving:**
Developers working with large GitHub organizations often struggle to manage and keep track of numerous repositories, requiring manual cloning and frequent checks for new repositories, leading to fragmented local development environments and missed project updates.

> [!NOTE]
> **Examples**:
> - "DevOps teams struggle to track and optimize cloud spending across multiple AWS accounts, leading to budget overruns and wasted resources"
> - "Developers working with microservices lack a centralized way to manage user authentication, resulting in inconsistent security implementations"
> - "Data analysts spend hours manually collecting and formatting metrics from different sources instead of focusing on insights"

**Our Unique Value Proposition:**
Gloton provides automated organization-wide repository discovery and synchronization, enabling developers to maintain complete, up-to-date local mirrors of entire GitHub organizations with a single command, eliminating manual repository management overhead.

> [!NOTE]
> **Examples**:
> - "Provides automated cost analysis with actionable recommendations, reducing cloud spending by 20-40% through intelligent resource optimization"
> - "Offers a unified authentication service with plug-and-play integration, reducing development time by 60% while ensuring security compliance"
> - "Delivers real-time analytics dashboard with automated data collection, enabling analysts to focus on insights rather than data preparation"

<rules>

## Rules

<instructions>
### Instructions

#### 1. Document Completion Protocol

You MUST execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to these protocols. This is your operational mandate - each section must be processed in sequence using the defined structure and validation checks.

#### 2. Mandatory Section Structure

Every section in this document follows this structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: Direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: Required output specifications. Generate ALL specified artifacts to mark section complete.
- **📋 Template Variables**: Variables requiring substitution (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`). Replace with correct values.

#### 3. Sequential Processing Requirements

Process sections in exact order without skipping. Do not proceed to next section until current section is complete and validated.

#### 4. Evidence-Based Analysis

All technical claims MUST include:

- Concrete file:line references with exact paths
- Direct quotes from source files when making assertions
- Systematic tool usage with documented verification steps
- Cross-validation of findings across multiple sources

#### 5. Anti-Hallucination Protocol

You are EXPLICITLY PERMITTED and ENCOURAGED to admit uncertainty. When you encounter:

- Insufficient information to make confident assessments
- Ambiguous or unclear repository structures
- Missing documentation or configuration files
- Technical details beyond your current analysis scope

You MUST respond with: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this. Additional [specific type of information] would be required for accurate analysis."

#### 6. Factual Grounding Requirements

For all repository analysis tasks:

- FIRST extract direct quotes from relevant files before making claims
- ALWAYS cite specific file:line references for every technical assertion
- NEVER make assumptions about code functionality without examining actual implementation
- When referencing configuration or documentation, quote exact text from source files

#### 7. External Knowledge Restriction

You MUST ONLY use information from:

- Files within the provided repository
- Tool outputs from repository analysis commands
- User-provided context and instructions

Do NOT supplement analysis with external knowledge about frameworks, tools, or technologies unless explicitly requested. Base all conclusions on observable evidence within the repository.
</instructions>

<constraints>
### Constraints

#### What You Must NOT Do

- Skip validation requirements or success criteria verification
- Make assumptions about repository structure without tool-based confirmation
- Generate template variables without actual context substitution
- Proceed with incomplete section artifacts
- Use vague or unverified technical claims
- Provide analysis without showing your reasoning process
- Make claims about code functionality without examining implementation
- Skip verification steps when analyzing complex repository structures

#### Verification Protocol

For every significant analysis or conclusion, you MUST:

1. **Show Your Work**: Use `<thinking>` tags to demonstrate step-by-step reasoning
2. **Verify Claims**: After making any technical assertion, verify it by finding supporting evidence
3. **Cross-Reference**: Validate findings against multiple sources within the repository
4. **Self-Correct**: If you cannot find supporting evidence for a claim, retract it immediately

Use this format for verification:
```
<thinking>
I claim that [specific assertion]. Let me verify this by:
1. Checking [specific file/location]
2. Looking for [specific evidence]
3. Cross-referencing with [related files]
</thinking>

Based on evidence from [file:line], I can confirm [verified claim].
```
</constraints>

<workflow>
### Workflow

#### Three-Phase Execution Protocol

##### Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis

<step number="1">
**Action**: Process user inputs and repository information
**Process**:
1. Analyze all provided materials for project understanding
2. Execute repository analysis tools (repomix) for structural overview
3. Synthesize data for downstream section population
**Output**: Preliminary project model ready for structured content generation
</step>

##### Phase 2: Structured Content Generation

<step number="2">
**Action**: Systematically populate each numbered section
**Process**:
1. Follow AI Assistant Instructions precisely for each section
2. Generate all Expected Outcomes artifacts with verification
3. Maintain PRP document coherence through cross-referencing
**Output**: Fully populated document with validated content
</step>

##### Phase 3: Final Validation

<step number="3">
**Action**: Comprehensive document review for consistency and completeness
**Process**:
1. Verify all cross-section dependencies are satisfied
2. Check application-type coherence (no CLI tools with web UX sections)
3. Confirm all template variables are properly substituted
**Output**: Validated, production-ready context engineering document
</step>

#### Response Structure Protocol

ALL responses MUST follow this XML-structured format for maximum clarity:

```xml
<analysis>
  <verification>
    [Your step-by-step verification process]
  </verification>
  
  <findings>
    [Direct quotes and file:line references]
  </findings>
  
  <conclusion>
    [Evidence-based conclusions only]
  </conclusion>
</analysis>
```

#### Context Requirements

Before providing any analysis, you MUST establish:

- **Repository Scope**: What files and directories you have access to
- **Analysis Boundaries**: What aspects you can and cannot assess
- **Tool Limitations**: What analysis tools are available and their constraints
- **Information Gaps**: What information is missing for complete analysis

State these explicitly using:
```xml
<context_assessment>
  <scope>[Available files and directories]</scope>
  <boundaries>[Analysis limitations]</boundaries>
  <tools>[Available analysis capabilities]</tools>
  <gaps>[Missing information needed]</gaps>
</context_assessment>
```
</workflow>
</rules>

## 1. Initial Codebase Awareness

### AI Assistant Instructions

**Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**

```
1. 🔧 VALIDATE TOOL → Verify `repomix` is installed and executable.
2. 🔍 DISCOVER → Run `repomix --help` to understand tool capabilities.
3. 📊 ANALYZE → Execute `repomix` to get the complete codebase structure.
4. 🌳 EXTRACT & CATALOG → Generate ASCII tree and create a table of ALL initial files.
5. 📖 READ & SUMMARIZE → Read the generated repomix file entirely and create comprehensive overview.
6. 📝 CREATE OVERVIEW DOC → Generate 00-codebase-awareness-overview.md with complete repo summary.
7. ✅ VALIDATE & PRESENT → Ensure both artifacts are complete and ready for downstream use.
```

### Detailed Implementation Steps

**Tool Validation:** Execute `command -v repomix` or `which repomix`. If the tool is not found, report an error and halt. This step is mandatory.

- **Fallback Check**: If `repomix` is not in PATH, check common installation locations: `~/.local/bin/repomix`, `./node_modules/.bin/repomix`
- **Installation Verification**: Run `repomix --version` to confirm the tool is executable

**Tool Discovery:** Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and output formats.

**Comprehensive Codebase Analysis:** Execute `repomix` with appropriate flags based on the repository context:

- **Primary Command (Recommended)**: `repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-empty-lines -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-analysis.md`
  - This provides comprehensive markdown output with clean formatting and compression
  - Includes full file contents, directory structure, and metadata
  - Uses Git change count sorting by default (most changed files at bottom)
- **For Large Repositories**: `repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-structure.md`
  - This generates structure-only output (no file contents) for faster analysis when full content isn't needed
- **For Deep Analysis**: `repomix --style markdown -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-full.md`
  - Uncompressed output with full file contents for detailed examination
- **Custom Filtering**: Use `--ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules"` to exclude noise files if needed
- **Config Override Note**: If repository has `repomix.config.json`, use `-o filename.md` to override config settings
- **Completeness Verification**: Ensure the command captures all key repository aspects (directory structure, file metadata, content processing, exclusion patterns)

**Output Processing & Extraction:**

- **Directory Tree Extraction**: From repomix output, locate the "Directory Structure" section and extract the ASCII tree
- **File Inventory Creation**: Parse the file list from repomix output, noting file types and sizes
- **Metadata Analysis**: Extract repository metadata (total files, total size, ignored patterns) from repomix summary

**Initial State Cataloging:**

- Create a complete table listing **all** discovered files with classifications:
  - `dotfile` (.gitignore, .env.example, .github/*, etc.)
  - `configuration` (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
  - `task-runner` (Makefile, Justfile, package.json scripts, etc.)
  - `documentation` (README.md, docs/*, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
  - `template` (.template files, example configs, scaffolding, etc.)
- **Purpose Inference**: For each file, infer purpose based on standard conventions and file patterns

**Error Handling & Validation:**

- **Verify Complete Output**: Ensure repomix completed successfully (no truncated output or error messages)
- **Validate Structure**: Confirm the directory tree matches expected patterns for the project type
- **Handle Large Repositories**: If output is too large, re-run with `--compress` or `--no-files` flags

**Synthesize Analysis:** Write a brief narrative summary interpreting the structured findings:

- State inferred project status (e.g., "newly initialized," "template-based," "active development")
- Highlight existing tooling and configuration patterns
- Note any unusual or non-standard repository structure

**Complete Repomix File Reading:** Read the entire generated repomix file (docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-analysis.md) from start to finish:

- **File Summary Section**: Extract purpose, format description, and usage guidelines from the header
- **Processing Notes Analysis**: Parse all metadata including exclusion patterns, file counts, compression settings, and sorting methods
- **User Header Extraction**: Capture any user-provided repository description or context
- **Directory Structure Analysis**: Parse the complete ASCII directory tree structure
- **File Classification**: Categorize all files by type, purpose, and development role
- **Configuration Pattern Analysis**: Examine dotfiles, build configs, package manifests, and CI/CD setups
- **Technology Stack Identification**: Identify languages, frameworks, and tools from file extensions, imports, and dependencies
- **Development Workflow Recognition**: Parse build tools, task runners, testing frameworks, and automation patterns
- **Security and Compliance Notes**: Identify any security-related files, configurations, or findings
- **Content Processing Details**: Understand what content was compressed, excluded, or processed differently

**Comprehensive Overview Generation:** Create a complete but lightweight repository overview:

- **Repository Classification**: Determine project type (web app, CLI, library, template, etc.)
- **Technology Stack Summary**: List primary languages, frameworks, and development tools
- **Project Structure Assessment**: Analyze organization patterns and architectural approach
- **Configuration Analysis**: Summarize key configuration files and their purposes
- **Development Environment**: Document build tools, task runners, and development workflows
- **Documentation Status**: Assess existing documentation and knowledge management

**Overview Document Creation:** Generate `docs/00_context_engineering/01-codebase-awareness-overview.md` with:

- **Source Reference**: Relative path to the repomix file (`00-repomix-analysis.md`)
- **Repomix Metadata Analysis**: Extract and summarize all key metadata from the repomix file header
- **Processing Statistics**: Include file counts, exclusion patterns, and processing configuration
- **Executive Summary**: 2-3 paragraph high-level repository overview
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Organized sections covering all repository aspects discovered in repomix
- **Security and Compliance**: Any security findings or compliance notes from the repomix analysis
- **Quick Reference**: Key files, commands, and entry points for immediate use

**🚫 Constraint:** Focus on structure, configuration, and tooling patterns. Do not perform deep analysis of file contents at this stage.

### Validation Requirements

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Operational Protocol & Consistency Mandate

For you, 🤖 AI agent - Your primary function is to execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to the protocols outlined below. This is not a guide; it is your operational mandate. Each section must be processed in sequence, using the defined structure and validation checks.

### Execution Structure

Every section in this document adheres to the following mandatory structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: This block contains your direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute them precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: This block defines the required output. You MUST generate all specified artifacts to mark the section as complete. Your output must be validated against these outcomes.
- **📋 Template Variables**: This block lists variables (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`) that require substitution. You MUST replace them with the correct values from the established context.

### Critical Document Consistency Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interdependent Sections Consistency Requirements**
>
> This document contains interdependent sections that must maintain consistency to ensure coherent context engineering. Each section builds upon previous sections and informs subsequent ones. You are required to follow these consistency protocols without deviation.

#### Mandatory Cross-Section Dependencies

**(Corrected Section Numbers)**

**Primary Dependencies (Critical):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 8 (Third Party Integrations)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 12 (Reference & Documentation)

**Secondary Dependencies (Important):**
- Section 5 (Software Architecture) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)

**Coherence Dependencies (Application-Type Specific):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 10 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture)

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Operational Protocol & Consistency Mandate

For you, 🤖 AI agent - Your primary function is to execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to the protocols outlined below. This is not a guide; it is your operational mandate. Each section must be processed in sequence, using the defined structure and validation checks.

### Execution Structure

Every section in this document adheres to the following mandatory structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: This block contains your direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute them precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: This block defines the required output. You MUST generate all specified artifacts to mark the section as complete. Your output must be validated against these outcomes.
- **📋 Template Variables**: This block lists variables (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`) that require substitution. You MUST replace them with the correct values from the established context.

### Critical Document Consistency Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interdependent Sections Consistency Requirements**
>
> This document contains interdependent sections that must maintain consistency to ensure coherent context engineering. Each section builds upon previous sections and informs subsequent ones. You are required to follow these consistency protocols without deviation.

#### Mandatory Cross-Section Dependencies

**(Corrected Section Numbers)**

**Primary Dependencies (Critical):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 8 (Third Party Integrations)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 12 (Reference & Documentation)

**Secondary Dependencies (Important):**
- Section 5 (Software Architecture) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)

**Coherence Dependencies (Application-Type Specific):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 10 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture)

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

### 2.2 Product Identity & Definition

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔍 PARSE & SYNTHESIZE → Consolidate context from Sections 1 & 2.1.
> 2. 📝 GENERATE SUMMARY → Create the comprehensive narrative product summary.
> 3. ⚙️ DEFINE & POPULATE TABLE → Define the product's names and populate the definition table.
> 4. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure all definitions are consistent and correctly formatted.
> 5. 📤 PRESENT → Output the product summary and the definition table.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Review the `Initial Codebase Synthesis` (Section 1) and the `Repository Summary Table` (Section 2.1) to establish the project's context.
> - **Product Summary Generation:** Based on the synthesized context and the user-provided `repository_description`, write a comprehensive product summary (2-3 paragraphs). This summary should be written from the perspective of a product manager explaining the product's purpose, value, and target audience to a stakeholder. This is the primary generative task of this section.
> - **Product Definition Table Generation:**
>     - Set the `Technical Name` to be the exact `repository_name` from Section 2.1.
>     - Create the `Display Name` by converting the `Technical Name` into a human-readable title case format (e.g., "cloud-cost-cli" becomes "Cloud Cost CLI").
>     - Use the `repository_description` from Section 2.1 for the `Description` field.
>     - Populate the "Product Definition Table" with these values.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - The `Technical Name` in the table MUST exactly match the `repository.name` from Section 2.1.
> - The `Display Name` MUST be a properly formatted, title-cased version of the `Technical Name`.
> - The generated `Product Summary` must be coherent and align logically with the one-sentence `Description` in the table.

#### Output Format

**Mandatory Structure - Present in this exact order:**

1.  **Product Summary:**

    *(A comprehensive, 2-3 paragraph overview of the product, its purpose, and its value proposition. This is the primary narrative artifact.)*

    Example:
    > CloudCost CLI is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help cloud engineers and DevOps teams streamline their Amazon Web Services infrastructure management. By providing intelligent cost analysis, resource rightsizing recommendations, and automated optimization strategies, this tool transforms complex cloud resource management into a simple, actionable process.
    >
    > The CLI leverages advanced algorithmic analysis to scan existing AWS environments, identifying underutilized or overprovisioned resources. Engineers can quickly generate comprehensive reports that highlight potential cost savings and recommend precise adjustments. With built-in safety checks and preview modes, teams can confidently optimize their cloud infrastructure without risking service disruptions.

2.  **Product Definition Table:**

    *(This table is the structured source of truth for the product's identity.)*

    | Field | Value | Purpose |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Technical Name** | `{{repository_name}}` | Used for configs, environment variables, and scripts. |
    | **Display Name** | `{{display_name}}` | Used for documentation, UI, and marketing. |
    | **Description** | `{{repository_description}}` | A concise, one-sentence summary of the product. |

- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Features

This section defines the comprehensive feature set organized as Epics and User Stories. AI assistants use this structured approach to understand functional requirements and generate downstream artifacts like PRDs, engineering tasks, and test plans.

### AI Assistant Process Flow

When processing feature definition requests, AI assistants must follow these steps in order:

1. **Synthesize**: Ingest context from Product Identity, Problem & Value Proposition, and user input
2. **Define Epics**: Group user requirements into high-level feature categories (Epics)
3. **Formulate User Stories**: For each Epic, define specific, testable capabilities as user stories
4. **Prioritize**: Classify each Epic and its User Stories into tiers (MVP, etc.)
5. **Validate**: Ensure absolute coherence with Application Type and Problem Statement
6. **Present**: Output the features in the structured format below

### Detailed Implementation Steps

**Context Synthesis:**
Your primary inputs are the Problem & Value Proposition section and the user-provided feature list. These form the foundation for all feature prioritization and story creation decisions.

**Epic Definition:**
Analyze the user's requirements and group them into logical, high-level categories that are applicable to any application type (e.g., `Core Functionality`, `User Management`, `Data Processing`, `Integration`). These are your "Epics."

**User Story Formulation:**
For each Epic, define its capabilities as concrete, testable user stories:
- **Format**: "As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`."
- **Persona**: Must be a specific, relevant user role (e.g., `DevOps Engineer`, `End User`, `System Administrator`)
- **Action**: Must describe a single, verifiable capability. The action should be granular enough to be the basis for a set of implementation tasks, but not the tasks themselves
- **Benefit**: Must align directly with the Value Proposition from the Problem & Value Proposition section

**Prioritization:**
Assign each Epic and its constituent User Stories to one of three tiers:
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Essential for the core, functional version
- **Next Phase**: Important enhancements for after the MVP is stable
- **Nice to Have**: Desirable features that improve the experience but are not critical

### Validation Requirements

The following requirements must be met for any generated features:

- All Epics and User Stories MUST be coherent with the Application Type (e.g., no "Interactive Dashboard" stories for a CLI tool)
- Every User Story's `[Benefit]` MUST directly support the Value Proposition
- The set of MVP stories, when combined, MUST fully address the Problem Statement
- This section defines the **scope** of work. It MUST NOT contain the implementation details (tasks) or granular test criteria (UAC), which are generated from this section

### Output Format

**MVP Features (Core Functional Scope)**

* **Epic: `[Name of the first high-level feature category]`**
    * **Target Persona:** `[Primary user for this epic]`
    * **User Stories:**
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.

* **Epic: `[Name of the second high-level feature category]`**
    * **Target Persona:** `[Primary user for this epic]`
    * **User Stories:**
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.

**Next Phase Features (Key Enhancements)**

* **Epic: `[Name of the third high-level feature category]`**
    * **Target Persona:** `[Primary user for this epic]`
    * **User Stories:**
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.

**Nice to Have Features (Future Improvements)**

* **Epic: `[Name of the fourth high-level feature category]`**
    * **Target Persona:** `[Primary user for this epic]`
    * **User Stories:**
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.

### Downstream Artifact Generation

The Epics and User Stories defined in this section are the foundational input for generating more detailed, scoped documents. Subsequent AI processes (PRPs) will use this section to generate:
- **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Expanding each Epic with detailed context
- **Engineering Task Tickets**: Breaking down each User Story into granular, actionable implementation tasks
- **Test Plans**: Creating detailed User Acceptance Criteria (UAC) and test cases for each User Story

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Operational Protocol & Consistency Mandate

For you, 🤖 AI agent - Your primary function is to execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to the protocols outlined below. This is not a guide; it is your operational mandate. Each section must be processed in sequence, using the defined structure and validation checks.

### Execution Structure

Every section in this document adheres to the following mandatory structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: This block contains your direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute them precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: This block defines the required output. You MUST generate all specified artifacts to mark the section as complete. Your output must be validated against these outcomes.
- **📋 Template Variables**: This block lists variables (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`) that require substitution. You MUST replace them with the correct values from the established context.

### Critical Document Consistency Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interdependent Sections Consistency Requirements**
>
> This document contains interdependent sections that must maintain consistency to ensure coherent context engineering. Each section builds upon previous sections and informs subsequent ones. You are required to follow these consistency protocols without deviation.

#### Mandatory Cross-Section Dependencies

**(Corrected Section Numbers)**

**Primary Dependencies (Critical):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 8 (Third Party Integrations)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 12 (Reference & Documentation)

**Secondary Dependencies (Important):**
- Section 5 (Software Architecture) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)

**Coherence Dependencies (Application-Type Specific):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 10 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture)

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

### 11. AI Assistant Guidance

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔄 SYNTHESIZE → Ingest context from Tech Stack (7), SW Architecture (5), and UX/DX (6).
> 2. 🧠 DERIVE PITFALLS → Based on the stack and patterns, generate the AI Common Pitfalls table.
> 3. 🎯 DEFINE GUIDANCE → Formulate explicit behavioral rules and domain patterns.
> 4. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure guidance is actionable and directly relevant to the project context.
> 5. 📤 PRESENT → Output the complete guidance protocol.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Your primary inputs are the `Tech Stack` (Sec 7), `Software Architecture` (Sec 5), and `UX/DX` (Sec 6).
> - **Derive AI Pitfalls:** You will not list generic pitfalls. You will **derive specific pitfalls** directly from the project's context.
>     - For each core technology in the `Tech Stack`, identify 1-2 common, high-risk errors (e.g., for `React`: "Incorrectly managing state, leading to unnecessary re-renders"; for `Go`: "Ignoring error returns, leading to nil pointer panics").
>     - For each architectural pattern in `Software Architecture`, identify a potential misapplication.
> - **Define Behavioral Guidance:** Formulate a list of 3-5 non-negotiable rules for any agent working on this codebase (e.g., "Always generate unit tests for new business logic," "Ask for clarification before modifying a core module").
> - **Define Domain-Specific Patterns:** Codify the project's conventions. This includes preferred coding styles, naming conventions, and specific implementation patterns that should be followed (e.g., "All new API endpoints MUST use the defined `api.Controller` struct.").
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - Every pitfall listed in the table MUST be directly relevant to a technology or pattern used in this project.
> - Behavioral guidance rules MUST be clear, unambiguous, and actionable.
> - Domain-specific patterns MUST be concrete and provide examples where necessary.

#### Output Format

**1. AI Common Pitfalls:**
*(This table provides guardrails for future AI agents to prevent common, context-specific errors.)*

| Pitfall | What It Is | How to Identify | How to Solve/Overcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (e.g., Forgetting `defer` in Go) | In Go, failing to use `defer` for cleanup actions like closing files can lead to resource leaks. | Look for functions that open resources (`os.Open`, `db.Conn`) but lack a corresponding `defer resource.Close()` call immediately after. | **Mandatory Protocol:** Immediately after successfully opening a resource that requires closing, the very next line MUST be the `defer` statement to close it. |
| (e.g., Prop Drilling in React) | Passing props down through multiple layers of components instead of using a state management solution or Context API. | A component receives and passes on props without using them itself. The same prop appears at many levels of the component tree. | **Mandatory Protocol:** For state shared by more than 2-3 levels of components, use the established state management library (`Zustand`/`Redux`) or React's Context API. Do not pass props through intermediate components. |

**2. Behavioral Guidance (Mandatory Protocols):**
- **Principle of Least Astonishment:** Generated code should follow the existing patterns in the codebase. Do not introduce new design patterns without explicit instruction.
- **Confirmation Before Destructive Actions:** You MUST ask for explicit user confirmation before generating code that performs destructive actions (e.g., `DELETE` from a database, `rm -rf`).
- **Test Generation Requirement:** All new public functions or methods containing business logic MUST be accompanied by a corresponding unit test.

**3. Domain-Specific Patterns & Conventions:**
- **Naming Conventions:** All Go interfaces will be named with an `-er` suffix (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).
- **API Error Responses:** All API error responses MUST conform to the `APIError` struct defined in `/pkg/errors/errors.go`.
- **State Management:** Global UI state is managed via the `Zustand` store defined in `src/state/store.js`. Do not use component-local state for data that needs to be shared globally.

3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## 📋 Project Overview

### Project Identity

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Start with these fundamental questions to establish project identity:
> - "What is the official name of your project?"
> - "What type of project are you building?" (Show options: CLI Tool, Web App, Library, etc.)
> - "In 1-2 sentences, what does your project do and what problem does it solve?"
> - "Who is your target audience?" (Developers, end users, enterprises, etc.)

- **Name**: {Project Name}
- **Type**: {CLI Tool | Web Application | Library | Framework | API Service | Mobile App | Desktop Application | Other}
- **Purpose**: {1-2 sentence description of what this project does and why it exists}
- **Target Audience**: {Who will use this project - developers, end users, enterprises, etc.}

> [!TIP]
> **For AI Agents**: Use the project type to automatically determine which configuration patterns to apply (e.g., CLI tools need different .gitignore patterns than web applications).

### Primary Language & Runtime

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Essential technical foundation questions:
> - "What is your primary programming language?"
> - "What runtime or platform does it use?"
> - "What's the minimum version you want to support?"
> 
> **Why This Matters**: This determines tooling, dependency management, and build configurations.

- **Main Language**: {Go | JavaScript/TypeScript | Python | Rust | Java | C# | Other}
- **Runtime/Platform**: {Node.js | .NET | JVM | Native | Browser | Other}
- **Minimum Version**: {Specify minimum supported version}

> - "What framework or library forms the backbone of your project?"
> - "Do you use a database? Which one?"
> - "How do you handle authentication?" (if applicable)
> - "What testing framework do you use?"
> 
> **Context**: These choices drive configuration file patterns and development setup.

- **Primary Framework**: {Express.js | React | Django | Gin | FastAPI | Spring Boot | Other | None}
- **Database**: {PostgreSQL | MySQL | MongoDB | SQLite | Redis | None | Other}
- **Authentication**: {JWT | OAuth2 | Session-based | None | Other}
- **Testing Framework**: {Jest | pytest | go test | JUnit | Other | None}

> [!TIP]
> **Framework-Specific Configs**: Each framework has specific configuration needs (e.g., React projects need .env handling, Django needs specific .gitignore patterns).

### Development Tools

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Development workflow questions:
> - "What build system do you use?" (npm, go modules, pip, etc.)
> - "Do you use a linter? Which one?"
> - "Do you use code formatting? Which tool?"
> - "What CI/CD platform do you use?"
> 
> **Purpose**: Determines .editorconfig, pre-commit hooks, and workflow configurations.

- **Build System**: {npm/yarn | go modules | pip | cargo | gradle | maven | other}
- **Linting**: {ESLint | golangci-lint | flake8 | clippy | other | none}
- **Formatting**: {Prettier | gofmt | black | rustfmt | other | none}
- **CI/CD**: {GitHub Actions | GitLab CI | Jenkins | other | none}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Consistency Impact**: These tools directly affect .editorconfig, .gitignore, and CI/CD workflow configurations.

### External Dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Focus on major dependencies:
> - "What are the 3-5 most important external libraries or services your project depends on?"
> - "What role does each dependency play in your project?"
> 
> **Note**: Don't list every dependency—focus on key ones that define capabilities or affect configuration.

List key external libraries, frameworks, or services:
- {Dependency 1}: {Purpose/Role in project}
- {Dependency 2}: {Purpose/Role in project}
- {Dependency 3}: {Purpose/Role in project}

> [!TIP]
> **Configuration Impact**: Major dependencies often require specific .gitignore patterns, environment variables, or documentation sections.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

### Project Type Classification

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Multiple selection question:
> - "Which of these best describe your project architecture?" (Allow multiple selections)

# Cursor Documentation Clarity Enforcement Rule

## Description

This rule mandates that Cursor proactively analyzes documentation during editing to detect redundancies and jargon violations that compromise clarity. When editing any documentation, Cursor must alert users to redundant content, unnecessary jargon, and clarity violations even if the user hasn't spotted them. This enforcement is particularly critical for prompt-engineering and context-engineering tasks where precision and clarity are paramount.

**Core Principle**: Jargon-free and redundancy-free documentation is the law.

## Rule

1. **Mandatory Redundancy Detection**: Scan for and alert about:
   - **Tautologies**: Statements making the same point in different ways
   - **Pleonasms**: Phrases containing unnecessary words
   - **Repetitive Content**: Identical concepts restated without adding value
   - **Verbose Explanations**: Content that can be simplified without losing meaning

2. **Jargon Violation Detection**: Identify and suggest replacements for:
   - **Undefined Technical Terms**: Domain-specific vocabulary without explanation
   - **Unexplained Abbreviations**: Acronyms/initialisms used without definition
   - **Industry Jargon**: Professional terminology that excludes non-experts
   - **Complex Language**: Unnecessarily sophisticated words when simpler alternatives exist

3. **Prompt-Engineering Clarity Focus**: Apply stricter standards for:
   - **Prompt Design Documents**: Eliminate ambiguous instructions and undefined terms
   - **Context-Engineering Guidelines**: Ensure every directive is immediately actionable
   - **AI Interaction Specifications**: Remove meta-discourse and verbose explanations
   - **Template Documentation**: Maintain consistency in terminology and format

4. **Proactive Alert Protocol**:
   - Alert immediately upon detecting violations during editing
   - Provide specific line references for identified issues
   - Suggest concrete replacements for jargon and redundant content
   - Highlight inconsistent terminology across the document

5. **Clarity Enforcement Standards**:
   - Replace weak language ("might", "could", "perhaps") with definitive statements
   - Eliminate meta-discourse ("as mentioned above", "you should know")
   - Ensure active voice and clear subject identification
   - Maintain terminology consistency throughout documents

6. **Documentation Type Sensitivity**: Apply appropriate standards based on:
   - **Technical Specifications**: High precision, defined terminology
   - **User Guides**: Accessible language, minimal jargon
   - **API Documentation**: Consistent naming, clear examples
   - **Process Documentation**: Step-by-step clarity, no ambiguity

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will:
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuously scan content during editing for redundancy and jargon patterns
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Display contextual warnings with specific violation details and improvement suggestions
- **Terminology Database**: Maintain project-specific glossaries to ensure consistency
- **Severity Classification**: Distinguish between critical clarity issues and minor improvements
- **Automated Suggestions**: Provide one-click replacements for common jargon and redundancy patterns
- **Document Type Recognition**: Apply appropriate clarity standards based on file location and content type

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Clear, Redundancy-Free Content

```markdown
# API Authentication

Use API keys to authenticate requests.

## Setup Steps
1. Generate API key in dashboard
2. Add key to request headers
3. Test connection

## Required Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}
```

## Error Handling
- 401: Invalid key
- 403: Insufficient permissions
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Redundant and Jargon-Heavy Content

```markdown
# API Authentication Implementation and Configuration

In order to properly authenticate API requests in your application, 
you need to utilize API keys for the authentication process. This 
authentication mechanism allows you to authenticate and verify requests.

## Setup and Configuration Steps
1. You should generate an API key in the dashboard interface
2. After generating the key, you need to add the key to your request headers
3. Once you've added the headers, test the connection to verify functionality

## Required Headers for Authentication
```
Authorization: Bearer {your-api-key}
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- 401 Unauthorized: This indicates an invalid key was provided
- 403 Forbidden: This means insufficient permissions were granted

Problems:
- "authentication process" → redundant with "authenticate"
- "authentication mechanism" → jargon
- "interface" → unnecessary qualifier
- "Once you've added" → verbose meta-discourse
- Repetitive explanations of obvious concepts
```

### ✅ Correct: Prompt-Engineering Clarity

```markdown
# Context Engineering Rule Template

## Rule Structure
1. Define specific behavior
2. Include concrete examples
3. Specify output format

## Implementation
- Use imperative commands
- Avoid conditional language
- Reference exact file paths

## Validation
Test rule effectiveness with sample inputs.
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Prompt-Engineering Jargon

```markdown
# Context Engineering Rule Template and Guidelines

When you're designing context engineering rules, you should consider
implementing a comprehensive framework that leverages best practices
for prompt optimization and contextual directive specification.

## Rule Structure and Architecture
1. You need to define specific behavioral parameters
2. It's important to include concrete illustrative examples
3. You should specify the desired output format and structure

## Implementation Guidelines and Best Practices
- You should utilize imperative command structures when possible
- It's recommended to avoid conditional or ambiguous language constructs
- Consider referencing exact file paths for optimal specificity

## Validation and Testing Procedures
You should test rule effectiveness using sample inputs to ensure
proper functionality and optimal performance characteristics.

Problems:
- "comprehensive framework" → jargon
- "leverages best practices" → business speak
- "behavioral parameters" → technical jargon
- "illustrative examples" → redundant
- "language constructs" → unnecessary complexity
- Verbose meta-discourse throughout
```

### Visual Clarity Patterns

```
Documentation Clarity Hierarchy:

High Clarity:
├── Direct statements ✅
├── Concrete examples ✅
├── Consistent terminology ✅
└── Active voice ✅

Medium Clarity:
├── Some technical terms (defined) ⚠️
├── Passive voice occasionally ⚠️
└── Minor redundancy ⚠️

Low Clarity:
├── Undefined jargon ❌
├── Repetitive content ❌
├── Meta-discourse ❌
└── Ambiguous instructions ❌
```

# Repository Context Review

## Description

This rule mandates that Cursor always performs a comprehensive repository context review and understanding of the codebase structure using `repomix` (available in the system) before executing any development tasks. This ensures informed decision-making based on complete project knowledge including architecture, patterns, dependencies, and configuration.

## Rule

Execute this mandatory context review protocol for every repository task:

1. **Initial Repository Analysis**: Execute `repomix` to generate comprehensive, AI-friendly codebase representation before task execution.

2. **Configuration Awareness**: Reference project-specific `repomix.config.json` file located at repository root containing:
   - Schema validation: Latest repomix schema for IDE autocomplete and validation
   - Output format: XML style with template-specific header for AI analysis
   - Compression: Enabled for token optimization and faster AI processing
   - File size limits: 50MB maximum for large repository handling
   - Git integration: Sorts files by change frequency with 100 commit analysis
   - Security checks: Enabled for sensitive data protection
   - Template-optimized ignore patterns: Comprehensive exclusion of build artifacts, logs, and system files
   - Empty directories: Included to show complete repository structure
   - Token encoding: o200k_base for optimal AI model compatibility

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyze repomix output to understand:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Key dependencies and configuration files
   - Code patterns and architectural decisions
   - File relationships and imports
   - Documentation and setup requirements

4. **Context-Informed Actions**: Base all development decisions on comprehensive codebase understanding rather than assumptions.

5. **Configuration Optimization**: Leverage the optimized repomix configuration which includes:
   - Schema validation with official repomix schema for enhanced IDE support
   - Compression enabled for token efficiency and faster AI processing
   - Template-specific header text for clear context identification
   - Comprehensive ignore patterns covering build artifacts, system files, and development byproducts
   - Git change tracking for prioritizing recently modified files (100 commit analysis)
   - Security scanning enabled for sensitive data protection
   - Empty directory inclusion for complete repository structure visualization
   - Increased top files display (10 files) for better project overview

## Implementation

### Technical Integration

```bash
# Always run repomix first to understand repository context
repomix

# The command will use the optimized repomix.config.json configuration:
# - Schema validation enabled for enhanced development experience
# - Outputs to repomix-output.xml with template-specific header
# - Compression enabled for token optimization
# - Comprehensive ignore patterns for template repositories
# - Git change analysis with 100 commit history
# - Security scanning for sensitive data protection
# - Empty directory inclusion for complete structure view
# - Enhanced top files display (10 files) for better overview
# - Uses o200k_base token encoding for optimal AI compatibility
```

### Workflow Integration

1. **Pre-Task Execution**: Execute `repomix` before coding, debugging, or architectural decisions
2. **Configuration Reference**: Check project's `repomix.config.json` for specific settings
3. **Output Analysis**: Review generated `repomix-output.xml` for complete project context
4. **Informed Decision Making**: Apply comprehensive codebase knowledge to all subsequent actions

### Command Options

Repomix supports extensive configuration through the existing config file and additional CLI options:

- `--style xml` (configured in config): Optimized for AI processing with structured output
- `--compress true` (configured): Enabled by default for token optimization and faster processing
- `--include-diffs false` (configured): Disabled to focus on current state rather than changes
- `--top-files-len 10` (configured): Show top 10 most important files for comprehensive overview
- `--token-count-encoding o200k_base` (configured): Optimized token counting for AI models
- `--include-empty-directories true` (configured): Show complete directory structure including empty folders
- Schema validation: Automatic with `$schema` property for enhanced IDE support

## Benefits

### Enhanced Code Quality
- **Architectural Awareness**: Understand existing patterns before implementing new features
- **Consistency**: Maintain codebase conventions and standards
- **Dependency Understanding**: Avoid conflicts with existing dependencies

### Improved Efficiency
- **Context-Driven Development**: Make informed decisions rather than exploratory changes
- **Reduced Refactoring**: Understand the codebase structure to implement changes correctly the first time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify reusable components and established patterns

### Better Collaboration
- **Documentation**: Understand project documentation and setup requirements
- **Team Conventions**: Follow established coding patterns and organizational standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive understanding reduces onboarding time

### Risk Mitigation
- **Security Awareness**: Leverage built-in security scanning
- **Change Impact**: Understand how modifications affect other parts of the system
- **Configuration Compliance**: Respect project-specific settings and constraints

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Approach

```bash
# Step 1: Always start with repository context review
repomix

# Step 2: Analyze the generated repomix-output.xml to understand:
# - Project structure in the directory structure section
# - Key files and their purposes in the file summary
# - Dependencies in package.json or similar config files
# - Git activity patterns for recently changed areas

# Step 3: Proceed with informed development decisions
# Example: Implementing a new feature
# - Check existing similar implementations
# - Follow established patterns
# - Understand dependency requirements
# - Respect configuration constraints
```

**Repository Structure Understanding:**
```
project-root/
├── repomix.config.json     # ← Project-specific repomix configuration
├── repomix-output.xml      # ← Generated context file
├── src/                    # ← Source code (understand patterns)
├── docs/                   # ← Documentation (read setup requirements)
├── scripts/                # ← Automation (understand workflows)
└── justfile               # ← Build automation (understand commands)
```

### ❌ Incorrect Approach

```bash
# ❌ Starting development without context understanding
npm install some-package

# ❌ Modifying files without understanding project structure
edit src/main.js

# ❌ Making architectural decisions without codebase knowledge
mkdir new-feature-directory

# ❌ Ignoring project-specific repomix configuration
repomix --style plain --no-security-check  # Overrides project settings
```

### Context-Aware Development Pattern

```bash
# ✅ Proper workflow for any development task
repomix  # Uses project's repomix.config.json automatically

# Analyze output for:
# 1. Existing similar functionality
# 2. Project conventions and patterns
# 3. Dependencies and their usage
# 4. Documentation and setup requirements
# 5. Recent changes and active development areas

# Then proceed with informed implementation
```

### Configuration-Aware Usage

The project's `repomix.config.json` is optimized for template repositories with:
- **Schema Validation**: Latest repomix schema (`$schema`) for enhanced IDE support and validation
- **Compression Enabled**: Reduces token count while preserving essential structure and context
- **Template-Specific Header**: Clear identification as "Repository Template" for AI analysis context
- **50MB file size limit**: Handles large repositories efficiently for comprehensive analysis
- **XML output format**: Structured data optimized for AI processing and parsing
- **Enhanced Top Files Display**: Shows 10 most important files for better project overview
- **Git integration**: Prioritizes recently changed files with 100 commit analysis depth
- **Security scanning**: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data and credentials
- **Comprehensive ignore patterns**: Excludes build artifacts, system files, logs, and development byproducts
- **Empty directory inclusion**: Shows complete repository structure for template understanding
- **Token optimization**: Uses o200k_base encoding for optimal AI model compatibility

Always respect these configurations as they are specifically optimized for template repository analysis and AI-assisted development workflows.

# Auto-Repomix on Technology Changes

## Description

Execute `repomix` command automatically when new technologies, dependencies, or significant configuration changes are detected to maintain current repository analysis for AI tools.

## Rule

Execute `repomix` when these technology files change:

1. **Package Dependencies**: On modification of `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`
2. **Build Configurations**: On creation/modification of `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
3. **New Languages**: On first occurrence of new file extensions (`.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.py`)
4. **Major Config Changes**: On modification of build tool configs (`webpack.config.js`, `vite.config.js`)

### Execution Command

```bash
repomix  # Uses existing repomix.config.json configuration
```

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Monitors technology files for changes
- Triggers repomix execution automatically
- Prevents outdated repository analysis

**Technical Enforcement:**
- File watcher on specified glob patterns
- Automatic command execution on change detection
- Uses existing `repomix.config.json` settings

## Benefits

1. **Current Analysis**: Keeps repository context up-to-date for AI tools
2. **Automatic Execution**: No manual repomix command required
3. **Technology-Aware**: Triggers only on meaningful changes
4. **Efficient**: Uses optimized repomix configuration

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Trigger Events

**Adding TypeScript:**
```bash
# Changes detected:
package.json (+ typescript dependency)
tsconfig.json (new file)

# Automatic action:
repomix  # Regenerates analysis with TypeScript files
```

**Adding Docker:**
```bash
# Changes detected:
Dockerfile (new file)

# Automatic action:
repomix  # Updates analysis to include Docker configuration
```

### ❌ Incorrect Manual Usage

```bash
# ❌ Manual repomix execution without trigger
repomix  # Run unnecessarily on documentation changes

# ❌ Ignoring the automation
# Making technology changes but manually skipping repomix execution
```

### Trigger Pattern Examples

```
Technology File Changes → Auto Repomix
├── package.json modified → repomix
├── go.mod created → repomix
├── requirements.txt updated → repomix
├── Dockerfile added → repomix
└── Documentation changes → no trigger
```

# CC Cursor Rule Create Command Guidelines

## Description

The `cc_cursor_rule_create` command generates comprehensive, production-ready cursor rules in proper MDC format with complete YAML frontmatter, structured content sections, and practical implementation guidance. This command operates as a systematic single-phase creation process that delivers cursor rule files matching exceptional precision and structural integrity expected from Senior+ technical writers with 7+ years documentation experience.

**Command Version**: 1.2.0 - Enhanced with extended thinking integration, XML structuring framework, evidence verification protocols, and chain-of-thought reasoning validation.

## Rule

When using the `cc_cursor_rule_create` command, you MUST adhere to these directives:

1. **Mandatory Prefix Compliance**: Always begin responses with "**Mr. Alex 🤖, (v7.1)**" as specified in the core mandate.

2. **TodoWrite Integration Requirements**: 
   - Create structured todo lists before command execution using the TodoWrite tool
   - Track progress systematically through all 14 mandatory checklist items
   - Mark items as completed only after verification
   - Maintain visual progress indicators throughout execution

3. **Extended Thinking Protocol**:
   - Use `think hard` keyword for complex cursor rule creation (16K+ tokens allocation)
   - Apply systematic problem decomposition with clear logical progression
   - Evaluate minimum 2-3 alternative approaches with pros/cons analysis
   - Include confidence scoring (High: 90-100%, Medium: 70-89%, Low: 50-69%)

4. **File Creation Protocol**:
   - MUST create physical `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directory using Write tool
   - Follow kebab-case naming convention: `[rule-name].mdc`
   - Validate directory structure exists before file creation
   - Never display content only in terminal - generate actual files

5. **YAML Frontmatter Specifications**:
   - Include `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields
   - Use proper glob patterns: `["*.ts", "*.js"]` for multiple patterns, `""` for global
   - Apply appropriate globs based on rule target scope
   - Validate YAML syntax compliance

6. **Content Structure Requirements**:
   - Description: Clear explanation of rule purpose and scope
   - Rule: Numbered, actionable directives with specific requirements
   - Implementation: Technical details about cursor IDE enforcement
   - Benefits: Organizational and workflow advantages
   - Examples: Both correct (✅) and incorrect (❌) patterns with ASCII diagrams

7. **File/Directory Reference Validation**:
   - Verify all referenced paths exist using Read or LS tools
   - Correct non-existent paths or mark as creation requirements
   - Use relative paths only (e.g., `src/components/` not `/absolute/path/`)
   - Document path corrections in rule content

8. **Rule Conciseness & Completeness**:
   - Ensure rules are self-contained with full context
   - Eliminate verbose explanations while preserving functionality
   - Use direct, imperative language (e.g., "Execute repomix" not "Consider running...")
   - Maintain actionability when piped into other rules

9. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
   - Support all technical claims with verifiable evidence
   - Include confidence levels for recommendations
   - Reference specific documentation sources
   - Validate logical consistency throughout rule content

10. **Quality Assurance Gates**:
    - Validate final file format and syntax
    - Confirm all mandatory sections present
    - Verify markdown formatting compliance
    - Check structural integrity against reference standards

## Implementation

The cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:

- **Real-time Validation**: Checking command execution against the 10 mandatory directives
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring TodoWrite tool usage and checklist completion
- **File Creation Verification**: Ensuring physical `.mdc` files are generated in correct location
- **Format Compliance**: Validating YAML frontmatter syntax and MDC structure

# Cursor Rules Editing Standards

## Description

This rule enforces structural consistency and metadata preservation when editing or modifying existing cursor rules. It ensures that all modifications maintain MDC format compliance, preserve YAML frontmatter integrity, and uphold content quality standards established during rule creation. For initial rule creation standards, see [cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc](cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc).

## Rule

Preserve structure when editing cursor rules:

1. **Preserve YAML**: Never remove `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` fields
2. **Maintain Sections**: Keep Description → Rule → Implementation → Benefits → Examples order
3. **Validate Changes**: Check YAML syntax and markdown formatting before saving
4. **Verify Links**: Ensure cross-references to other rules remain functional
5. **Test Globs**: Confirm glob patterns still target intended files

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Global application (`alwaysApply: true`) ensures continuous enforcement during all cursor rule editing operations
- Real-time validation prevents structural corruption during modification
- Contextual warnings when required sections are removed or modified
- Automatic syntax checking for YAML frontmatter and markdown content

**AI Behavior Guidance:**
- Enforces preservation of established rule structure during all modification tasks
- Prevents accidental removal of metadata or required content sections
- Validates that edits maintain consistency with established cursor rule standards
- Ensures modifications enhance rather than degrade rule quality and effectiveness

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Pre-save validation hooks that check structural integrity
- YAML frontmatter protection against accidental deletion or corruption
- Cross-reference validation to prevent broken links between rules
- Content quality checks that apply creation standards to modifications

## Benefits

1. **Structural Integrity**: Prevents corruption of cursor rule structure during editing operations
2. **Metadata Protection**: Safeguards critical YAML frontmatter from accidental removal or damage
3. **Quality Consistency**: Ensures modifications maintain the same high standards as initial creation
4. **Cross-Reference Stability**: Preserves links and relationships between related cursor rules
5. **Change Validation**: Provides systematic verification that edits improve rather than degrade rule effectiveness
6. **Audit Compliance**: Maintains proper documentation and tracking of all rule modifications

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Editing Approach

**Proper Modification Workflow:**

```
BEFORE EDITING:
- Verify YAML frontmatter intact
- Confirm all sections present  
- Check cross-reference links

DURING EDITING:
- Preserve required YAML fields
- Maintain section structure
- Keep cross-references functional

AFTER EDITING:
- Validate YAML syntax
- Verify section completeness
- Test cross-reference links
```

### ❌ Incorrect Editing Patterns

**Destructive Modification Examples:**

```markdown
# ❌ METADATA CORRUPTION:
# Before:
---
description: "Enforce coding standards"
globs: ["**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# After (WRONG):
description: "Updated standards"  # ❌ Missing YAML delimiters
globs: **/*.ts  # ❌ Invalid YAML syntax
# ❌ Missing alwaysApply field

# ❌ STRUCTURAL DAMAGE:
# Original sections: Description, Rule, Implementation, Benefits, Examples
# Modified (WRONG): Description, Rule, Benefits  # ❌ Missing Implementation and Examples

# ❌ CONTENT DEGRADATION:
# Original: "Execute systematic validation with specific criteria"
# Modified (WRONG): "Do validation stuff"  # ❌ Vague language introduced

# ❌ BROKEN CROSS-REFERENCES:
# Original: [cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc](cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc)
# Modified (WRONG): [creation standards](creation-standards.mdc)  # ❌ Broken link
```

# Task Breakdown Enforcement Rule

## Description

This rule ensures Cursor systematically breaks down complex tasks into manageable components using TodoLists or integrated TaskLists. When any action requires multiple steps or can be divided into subtasks, Cursor must create and maintain structured task lists to prevent errors, ensure completeness, and improve development workflow quality.

## Rule

1. **Multi-Step Detection**: Identify tasks requiring multiple sequential actions or those divisible into logical components (e.g., feature implementation, debugging, refactoring, file modifications across multiple locations).

2. **Mandatory TodoList Creation**: For tasks with 2+ steps, immediately create a structured TodoList using available task management tools before proceeding with implementation.

3. **Task Granularity**: Break tasks into specific, actionable items with clear completion criteria. Each item must be independently verifiable and executable.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Mark completed items immediately upon completion. Maintain visual progress indicators throughout task execution.

5. **Error Prevention Protocol**: Before marking any task complete, verify all dependencies and prerequisites are satisfied. Include validation steps in task lists.

6. **Documentation Integration**: Embed TodoLists directly in relevant code comments, documentation, or use integrated task management systems to maintain context.

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will:
- Automatically detect complex tasks during analysis phase
- Prompt for TodoList creation when multi-step operations are identified
- Provide structured templates for common task breakdown patterns
- Integrate with existing task management tools and workflows
- Validate task completion before proceeding to dependent operations
- Maintain task history for workflow improvement and pattern recognition

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Systematic Task Breakdown

```
Task: Implement user authentication feature

TodoList:
☐ 1. Design authentication data models
☐ 2. Create user registration endpoint
☐ 3. Implement login validation logic
☐ 4. Add password hashing utilities
☐ 5. Create JWT token management
☐ 6. Build authentication middleware
☐ 7. Add route protection mechanisms
☐ 8. Write comprehensive unit tests
☐ 9. Update API documentation
☐ 10. Validate security compliance
```

### ✅ Correct: Debugging with Structured Approach

```
Issue: API endpoint returning 500 errors

Diagnostic TodoList:
☐ 1. Reproduce error consistently
☐ 2. Check server logs for stack traces
☐ 3. Validate input parameters
☐ 4. Test database connection
☐ 5. Verify environment variables
☐ 6. Review recent code changes
☐ 7. Implement fix
☐ 8. Test fix thoroughly
☐ 9. Deploy to staging
☐ 10. Monitor production logs
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Ad-Hoc Implementation

```
Task: Fix the authentication bug

Action: Jump directly into modifying authentication.js without:
- Understanding the specific issue
- Creating a systematic approach
- Planning verification steps
- Considering dependencies or side effects
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Incomplete Task Breakdown

```
TodoList:
☐ Fix auth
☐ Test it
☐ Deploy

Problems:
- Tasks too vague and non-actionable
- Missing critical steps
- No validation criteria
- Insufficient granularity for error prevention
```

### Visual Task Organization

# Documentation Markdown Formatting Standards

## Description

This cursor rule enforces comprehensive markdown formatting standards to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation across all markdown files. The rule combines industry-standard markdownlint best practices with specific CLAUDE.md compliance guidelines to create maintainable, readable, and properly structured documentation.

**Primary Focus Areas:**
- Code block language specification requirements
- Header hierarchy and formatting standards
- Spacing and indentation consistency
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md style guidelines

## Rule

**MANDATORY FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Code Block Language Specification**
   - Replace generic ``` with ```markdown or specific language identifier
   - Always specify language for fenced code blocks: ```javascript, ```bash, ```python, etc.
   - Use ```markdown for markdown content examples
   - Use ```text for plain text examples

2. **Header Hierarchy Standards**
   - Use proper markdown headers (#, ##, ###) following logical semantic hierarchy
   - Headers MUST start at line beginning with no leading whitespace
   - Follow consistent header level progression (don't skip levels)

3. **Header Formatting Compliance**
   - NEVER use **bold** or *italic* formatting for headers
   - Headers must use hash symbols (#) not underline formatting
   - Single space required between hash symbols and header text

4. **Spacing Requirements**
   - Include blank line between headers and content
   - Include blank line before code blocks
   - Include blank line after code blocks (except when ending file)
   - No multiple consecutive blank lines (maximum one blank line)

5. **Code Block Indentation**
   - Ensure correct indentation when code blocks are nested in lists
   - Maintain consistent indentation levels
   - Use spaces for indentation, not tabs

6. **List and Code Block Integration**
   - Proper spacing around fenced code blocks within lists
   - Maintain list context when including code examples
   - Preserve list item continuation for multi-paragraph items

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**

- Automatically suggests language identifiers when typing ```
- Highlights violations of header formatting standards
- Provides real-time feedback on spacing requirements
- Auto-corrects common formatting inconsistencies
- Integrates with markdown preview for immediate validation

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Code Block Formatting

```markdown
# Proper Header

This is content with proper spacing.

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Language specified correctly");
}
```

More content here.

## Subheader

- List item

  ```bash
  echo "Properly indented in list"
  ```

- Another item
```

### ❌ Incorrect Code Block Formatting

```markdown
#No space after hash

**This should be a header**

Content without spacing.
```
function badExample() {
  console.log("No language specified");
}
```
More content immediately after.

###Skipped header level

- List item
```bash
echo "Improper indentation"
```
```

### File Structure Requirements

```

description: "Enforce structured YAML frontmatter for all markdown documentation files in docs/ directory to ensure consistency, findability, and LLM-friendly content organization"
globs: ["docs/**/*.md"]
alwaysApply: true

# Documentation Markdown Metadata Standards

## Description

This rule enforces comprehensive YAML frontmatter metadata for all markdown files within the `docs/` directory, including specifications, templates, guides, and reference materials. The standardized metadata structure enhances document discoverability, enables automated processing, and provides essential context for both human readers and AI systems.

## Rule

All markdown files in the `docs/` directory **MUST** include properly formatted YAML frontmatter with the following required fields:

1. **title**: Clear, descriptive document title (string, required)
2. **description**: Concise summary of document content and purpose (string, required)  
3. **version**: Semantic version number for document tracking (string, required)
4. **status**: Document maturity level (string, required) - valid values: `draft`, `review`, `stable`, `deprecated`
5. **category**: Document classification for organization (string, required) - examples: `overview`, `guide`, `reference`, `spec`, `template`
6. **updated**: ISO 8601 date of last modification (string, required) - format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
7. **authors**: List of document contributors (array, required) - minimum one author
8. **related**: Cross-references to related documentation (array, optional) - relative paths to other docs

### Frontmatter Structure Requirements

- YAML frontmatter must be enclosed by triple dashes (`---`) at the beginning and end
- Must be the first content in the file (no preceding content allowed)
- Use spaces for indentation (tabs not permitted)
- All string values containing special characters must be quoted
- Arrays must use YAML list format with hyphens

### File Path Validation

- All paths in the `related` field must use relative references from the docs/ directory
- Cross-directory references must use proper relative path syntax (e.g., `../category/file.md`)
- File extensions must be included in all references

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- File pattern matching targets all markdown files within `docs/` directory structure
- Global application (`alwaysApply: true`) ensures continuous enforcement across documentation
- Real-time validation prevents incomplete metadata from being saved
- Contextual suggestions based on document type and existing metadata patterns

**Technical Enforcement:**
1. **File Creation**: New markdown files in `docs/` trigger metadata template insertion
2. **File Editing**: Missing or malformed frontmatter generates warnings
3. **Content Review**: Incomplete metadata fields highlighted during editing
4. **Reference Validation**: Broken or invalid `related` file paths flagged

**Automated Workflow Integration:**
- Template generation for required frontmatter fields
- Auto-population of `updated` field with current date
- Validation of `status` and `category` enum values
- Relative path completion for `related` field references

## Benefits

### Content Organization
- **Systematic Classification**: Consistent categorization enables efficient content discovery
- **Version Tracking**: Document versioning supports change management and rollback capabilities
- **Status Awareness**: Clear maturity indicators guide appropriate document usage

### Discoverability Enhancement  
- **Search Optimization**: Structured metadata improves search accuracy and filtering
- **Content Relationships**: Cross-references create navigable documentation networks
- **LLM Context**: Rich metadata provides essential context for AI-powered documentation tools

### Maintenance Efficiency
- **Update Tracking**: Timestamp metadata enables freshness monitoring and maintenance scheduling
- **Responsibility Clarity**: Author attribution establishes ownership and contact points
- **Automation Support**: Standardized structure enables automated validation and processing

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Implementation

description: "Detect repository stack and update gitignore patterns accordingly"
globs: [".gitignore"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Stack-Aware Gitignore Management

## Description

Automatically update `.gitignore` patterns based on detected repository technology stack. Add stack-specific exclusions only when corresponding technology files are present.

## Rule

Execute stack detection and update `.gitignore` patterns:

1. **Detect Stack**: Scan for `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`
2. **Add Patterns**: Include technology-specific patterns only for detected technologies
3. **Preserve Security**: Always include universal security exclusions (`.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`)
4. **Avoid Bloat**: Do not add patterns for technologies not present in repository

### Stack Detection Commands

```bash
# Node.js detection
[ -f package.json ] && add_patterns="node_modules/ dist/ .npm npm-debug.log*"

# Python detection
[ -f requirements.txt ] && add_patterns="__pycache__/ *.pyc venv/ .pytest_cache/"

# Go detection
[ -f go.mod ] && add_patterns="vendor/ *.exe *.test go.work"

# Rust detection
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && add_patterns="target/ Cargo.lock"

# Docker detection
[ -f Dockerfile ] && add_patterns="docker-compose.override.yml"
```

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Triggers on technology file creation/modification
- Suggests `.gitignore` updates based on detected stack
- Prevents duplicate pattern addition

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Pattern validation before addition
- Duplicate pattern detection
- Alphabetical pattern organization

## Benefits

1. **Minimal Patterns**: Only includes patterns for technologies actually used
2. **Automatic Updates**: Detects new technologies and suggests exclusions
3. **Security First**: Always includes universal security patterns
4. **No Redundancy**: Prevents duplicate or irrelevant patterns

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Stack Detection

**Node.js Project:**
```bash
# Detected: package.json exists
# Add to .gitignore:
node_modules/
dist/
.npm
npm-debug.log*
```

**Go Project:**
```bash
# Detected: go.mod exists
# Add to .gitignore:
vendor/
*.exe
*.test
go.work
```

### ❌ Incorrect Pattern Addition

```bash
# ❌ Adding Python patterns to Node.js-only project
__pycache__/  # Technology not detected

# ❌ Adding all patterns regardless of stack
node_modules/  # In Go-only project
target/        # In Node.js-only project
```

# Justfile as Main Task Executor

## Description

This rule enforces the use of the Justfile as the central command runner and primary task executor for all development operations. Rather than running tools and commands directly, developers should define and execute tasks through the `just` command runner, ensuring consistency, discoverability, and maintainability across the development workflow.

## Rule

1. **Primary Task Execution**: Use `just [recipe]` commands instead of direct tool invocations (e.g., `just test` instead of `npm test`, `just build` instead of `make build`)

2. **Recipe Discovery**: Always run `just` or `just --list` to discover available tasks before executing commands

3. **New Task Definition**: When introducing new development operations, define them as recipes in the Justfile using:
   - Clear, descriptive recipe names following kebab-case convention
   - Proper shell configuration (`set shell := ["bash", "-uce"]` for error handling)
   - Environment variable loading (`set dotenv-load`) when needed
   - Appropriate dependencies between recipes

4. **Task Standardization**: Ensure all common development tasks are available through just recipes:
   - `just dev` for development server
   - `just test` for running tests  
   - `just build` for building the project
   - `just clean` for cleanup operations
   - `just lint` for code linting
   - `just format` for code formatting
   - `just deploy` for deployment operations

5. **Documentation Integration**: Include recipe descriptions using comments above each recipe and leverage `just --list` for task discovery

6. **Path References**: Use relative paths and project variables in recipes (e.g., `{{BUILD_DIR}}`, `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`)

7. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in recipes using shell flags and conditional logic

## Implementation

Cursor IDE enforces this rule by:

- **Command Suggestion**: When detecting direct tool commands (npm, yarn, make, cargo, etc.), suggest the corresponding `just` recipe equivalent
- **Recipe Validation**: Ensure new recipes follow proper Just syntax and conventions
- **Dependency Checking**: Verify recipe dependencies are correctly defined
- **Documentation Compliance**: Require recipe descriptions and maintain `just --list` discoverability
- **Path Validation**: Ensure all file and directory references in recipes use relative paths and exist in the project

## Benefits

- **Unified Interface**: Single entry point (`just`) for all development tasks
- **Self-Documenting**: `just --list` provides discoverable task documentation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Just handles shell differences across operating systems
- **Dependency Management**: Recipe dependencies ensure tasks run in correct order
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper environment variable loading and shell configuration
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: New team members can discover all available tasks easily
- **CI/CD Integration**: Consistent task interface between local development and CI/CD pipelines

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Using Just as Main Task Executor

```bash
# Discover available tasks
just
just --list

# Execute development tasks
just dev
just test
just build
just clean

# Execute tasks with parameters
just test unit
just deploy production
```

### ✅ Correct: Well-Structured Justfile Recipe

```just
# 🚀 Start development server with hot reload
dev:
    @echo "🚀 Starting development server..."
    @npm run dev || yarn dev || bun dev || deno task dev

# 🧪 Run test suite
test TEST="":
    @echo "🧪 Running tests{{if TEST != "" { " for " + TEST } else { "" }}}..."
    @if [ "{{TEST}}" != "" ]; then \
        npm test -- {{TEST}}; \
    else \
        npm test; \
    fi

# 🏗️ Build project for production
build: clean
    @echo "🏗️ Building for production..."
    @mkdir -p {{BUILD_DIR}}
    @npm run build
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Direct Tool Invocation

```bash
# Don't run tools directly
npm start
make build
cargo test
python -m pytest

# Don't use complex shell scripts without Just recipes
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force
bash -c "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
```

### ❌ Incorrect: Poorly Structured Justfile Recipe

```just
# Missing description and error handling
stuff:
    some-command
    another-command

# Hard-coded paths and no dependency management
bad:
    cd /absolute/path/to/project
    rm -rf /tmp/build
    make install
```

# Shell Script Compliance Rule

## Description

This rule enforces comprehensive shell script compliance by combining the project's ShellCheck configuration (`.shellcheckrc`) with Google Shell Style Guide standards. All shell scripts must pass ShellCheck validation and adhere to Google's formatting, naming, and coding conventions to ensure maintainability, security, and reliability.

## Rule

### 1. ShellCheck Configuration Compliance (MANDATORY)

1.1. **All shell scripts MUST pass ShellCheck validation** using the project's `.shellcheckrc` configuration:
   - Shell dialect: `bash` (as specified in `.shellcheckrc`)
   - Disabled warnings: SC2155, SC2250 (per project configuration)
   - Enabled checks: require-variable-braces, quote-safe-variables, check-unassigned-uppercase, deprecate-which
   - Severity level: warning minimum

1.2. **External sources handling** must follow project's `external-sources=true` setting

### 2. Google Shell Style Guide Compliance (MANDATORY)

2.1. **Shebang and File Header**:
   - Use `#!/bin/bash` for all executable shell scripts
   - Include descriptive file header comment explaining script purpose

2.2. **Function Definition and Structure**:
   - Use `function name() {` format (Google style with optional 'function' keyword)
   - Declare local variables with `local` keyword in functions
   - Use `readonly` for constants declared at file top

2.3. **Variable Handling and Quoting**:
   - Always quote variables: `"${variable}"` (required by shellcheck enable=require-variable-braces)
   - Use braces for all variable references: `${var}` not `$var`
   - Quote command substitutions: `"$(command)"`
   - Use arrays for lists: `declare -a FLAGS=(--foo --bar)`

2.4. **Error Handling and Exit Codes**:
   - Use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
   - Check command return values explicitly: `if ! command; then`
   - Use `|| return 1` or proper error handling for function failures

2.5. **Control Flow and Formatting**:
   - Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` for conditionals
   - Use `(( ... ))` for arithmetic operations
   - Format loops: `for var in "${array[@]}"; do`
   - Use 2-space indentation (never tabs)

2.6. **Command and Tool Usage**:
   - Prefer bash built-ins over external commands
   - Use `command -v` instead of `which` (enforced by shellcheck enable=deprecate-which)
   - Avoid `eval` and other dangerous constructs

### 3. Project-Specific Requirements

3.1. **Script Location**: All shell scripts must be organized in the `scripts/` directory structure
3.2. **Configuration Reference**: Scripts must be compatible with `.shellcheckrc` settings
3.3. **Documentation**: Include function header comments for complex functions

## Implementation

Cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:

1. **Real-time ShellCheck Integration**:
   - Run shellcheck with project's `.shellcheckrc` configuration on save
   - Display inline errors and warnings for shellcheck violations
   - Highlight disabled rules (SC2155, SC2250) when encountered

2. **Style Guide Validation**:
   - Flag incorrect shebang lines (not `#!/bin/bash`)
   - Detect unquoted variables and suggest `"${var}"` format
   - Warn about missing `local` declarations in functions
   - Identify missing error handling (`set -euo pipefail`)

3. **Auto-completion and Suggestions**:
   - Suggest proper variable expansion syntax
   - Recommend bash built-ins over external commands
   - Provide templates for Google-style function headers

4. **File Organization**:
   - Monitor files matching globs: `**/*.sh`, `**/*.bash`, `**/scripts/**/*`
   - Validate script placement within `scripts/` directory structure

## Benefits

### Code Quality and Reliability
- **Prevents Common Errors**: ShellCheck catches 90% of bash scripting mistakes before runtime
- **Consistent Standards**: Google Shell Style Guide ensures uniform code across team
- **Production-Ready**: Enforces error handling and defensive programming practices

### Maintainability and Collaboration
- **Readable Code**: Consistent formatting and naming conventions improve code comprehension
- **Documented Functions**: Required function headers enable better code understanding
- **Standard Practices**: Team members can quickly understand and modify any script

### Security and Performance
- **Secure Defaults**: Proper quoting prevents injection vulnerabilities
- **Optimized Performance**: Preference for bash built-ins over external commands
- **Error Prevention**: Strict error handling (`set -euo pipefail`) prevents silent failures

### Development Workflow
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time feedback during development
- **Automated Validation**: Consistent checking without manual intervention  
- **Quick Fixes**: Cursor IDE can suggest and apply corrections automatically

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Git hook management utility following Google Shell Style Guide
# Compliant with project's .shellcheckrc configuration

# Strict error handling
set -euo pipefail

# Constants (readonly as per Google style)
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly CONFIG_FILE="${SCRIPT_DIR}/.shellcheckrc"

#######################################
# Install pre-commit hooks with validation
# Globals:
#   CONFIG_FILE
# Arguments:
#   None
# Returns:
#   0 if successful, 1 on error
#######################################
function install_hooks() {
    local hook_types=("pre-commit" "pre-push")
    
    for hook_type in "${hook_types[@]}"; do
        if ! install_single_hook "${hook_type}"; then
            echo "Failed to install ${hook_type} hook" >&2
            return 1
        fi
    done
    
    echo "All hooks installed successfully"
}

# Main execution (Google style)
function main() {
    local command="${1:-}"
    
    case "${command}" in
        install)
            install_hooks
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: $0 {install}" >&2
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
}

# Execute main function if script is run directly
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    main "$@"
fi
```

### ❌ Incorrect Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Wrong shebang - should be #!/bin/bash

# Missing error handling - no set -euo pipefail
# Missing file header comment

SCRIPT_DIR=`dirname $0`  # Wrong: backticks, unquoted variables

install_hooks() {  # Wrong: missing 'function' or () format
    # Missing local declaration
    hook_types="pre-commit pre-push"  # Wrong: string instead of array
    
    for hook_type in $hook_types; do  # Wrong: unquoted expansion
        install_single_hook $hook_type  # Wrong: unquoted variable
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  # Wrong: [ instead of [[, checking $?
            echo "Failed to install $hook_type hook"  # Wrong: unquoted
            return 1
        fi
    done
    
    echo "All hooks installed successfully"
}

# Wrong: direct execution without main function
command=$1
case $command in  # Wrong: unquoted variables
    install)
        install_hooks
        ;;
    *)

### Directory Structure Visualization

```
✅ Correct Structure:
repo_template_empty/
├── .shellcheckrc                 # Project shellcheck configuration
├── scripts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── pre-commit-init.sh   # Compliant script
│   └── setup/
│       └── install.sh           # Compliant script
└── .cursor/
    └── rules/
        └── shell-script-compliance.mdc

❌ Incorrect Structure:
repo_template_empty/
├── random_script.sh             # Scripts outside scripts/ directory
├── bin/
│   └── helper.bash             # Non-standard location
└── tools/
    └── utility.sh              # Scattered script locations
```

### ShellCheck Integration Examples

```bash
# ✅ Compliant with .shellcheckrc settings

# SC2155 disabled - this is allowed in project
readonly LOCAL_PATH="$(get_local_path)"

# Variable braces required (enabled in .shellcheckrc)
echo "Processing file: ${filename}"  # ✅ Correct
echo "Processing file: $filename"    # ❌ Missing braces

# Quote safe variables (enabled in .shellcheckrc)  
port_number=8080
echo "Server running on port ${port_number}"  # ✅ Quoted

# Deprecate which (enabled in .shellcheckrc)
if command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1; then    # ✅ Use command -v
    echo "Git is available"
fi

if which git >/dev/null 2>&1; then         # ❌ Don't use which
    echo "Git is available"
fi

## File: docs/09_ai/04_ai_documentation/04.1_anthropic_prompt_engineering/anthropic-be-clear-direct-and-detailed.md
````markdown
When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working. The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude's response will be.

## How to be clear, contextual, and specific

-   **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
    -   What the task results will be used for
    -   What audience the output is meant for
    -   What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
    -   The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
-   **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
-   **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

## Examples

### Example: Anonymizing customer feedback

Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer's name.

| Role | Unclear Prompt | Clear Prompt |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| User | Please remove all personally identifiable information from these customer feedback messages: {{FEEDBACK_DATA}} | Your task is to anonymize customer feedback for our quarterly review.<br><br>Instructions:<br>1. Replace all customer names with "CUSTOMER_[ID]" (e.g., "Jane Doe" → "CUSTOMER_001").<br>2. Replace email addresses with "EMAIL_[ID]@example.com".<br>3. Redact phone numbers as "PHONE_[ID]".<br>4. If a message mentions a specific product (e.g., "AcmeCloud"), leave it intact.<br>5. If no PII is found, copy the message verbatim.<br>6. Output only the processed messages, separated by "---".<br><br>Data to process: {{FEEDBACK_DATA}} |
| Assistant (Claude's response) | Here are the anonymized customer feedback messages:<br>1. I've been using your software for years, and it's been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br>2. XXX, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process. My email is XXX if you want to send a survey.<br>3. I'm John Smith, and I'm not happy. I've been on hold for 2 hours trying to reach someone at XXX. This is unacceptable! | CUSTOMER_001: I've been using your software for years, and it's been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br>---<br>CUSTOMER_002: CUSTOMER_SERVICE_001, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process. My email is EMAIL_002@example.com if you want to send a survey.<br>---<br>CUSTOMER_003: I'm CUSTOMER_003, and I'm not happy. I've been on hold for 2 hours trying to reach someone at PHONE_001. This is unacceptable! |

### Example: Crafting a marketing email campaign

Notice that Claude makes up details to fill in the gaps where it lacks context with the vague prompt.

| Role | Vague Prompt | Specific Prompt |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| User | Write a marketing email for our new AcmeCloud features. | Your task is to craft a targeted marketing email for our Q3 AcmeCloud feature release.<br><br>Instructions:<br>1. Write for this target audience: Mid-size tech companies (100-500 employees) upgrading from on-prem to cloud.<br>2. Highlight 3 key new features: advanced data encryption, cross-platform sync, and real-time collaboration.<br>3. Tone: Professional yet approachable. Emphasize security, efficiency, and teamwork.<br>4. Include a clear CTA: Free 30-day trial with priority onboarding.<br>5. Subject line: Under 50 chars, mention "security" and "collaboration".<br>6. Personalization: Use {{COMPANY_NAME}} and {{CONTACT_NAME}} variables.<br><br>Structure:<br>1. Subject line<br>2. Email body (150-200 words)<br>3. CTA button text |
| Assistant (Claude's response) | Here's a draft marketing email for our new features:<br><br>Subject: Boost Your Business with AcmeCloud's Latest Features<br><br>Dear Valued Customer,<br><br>We're excited to introduce three powerful features to AcmeCloud that will revolutionize your workflow:<br>1. Real-Time Collaboration: Work on documents simultaneously with your team. No more version control issues!<br>2. AI-Powered Insights: Make data-driven decisions with AI that analyzes trends and automates tasks.<br>3. Advanced Security Suite: End-to-end encryption, multi-factor auth, and threat detection keep your data safe.<br><br>Limited Offer: Upgrade now for a 20% first-year discount.

````markdown
Extended thinking gives Claude 3.7 Sonnet enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while also providing transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.

## How extended thinking works

When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates `thinking` content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response.

The API response will include both `thinking` and `text` content blocks.

In multi-turn conversations, only thinking blocks associated with a tool use session or `assistant` turn in the last message position are visible to Claude and are billed as input tokens; thinking blocks associated with earlier `assistant` messages are [not visible](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#the-context-window-with-extended-thinking) to Claude during sampling and do not get billed as input tokens.

## Implementing extended thinking

Add the `thinking` parameter and a specified token budget to use for extended thinking to your API request.

The `budget_tokens` parameter determines the maximum number of tokens Claude is allowed use for its internal reasoning process. Larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis for complex problems, although Claude may not use the entire budget allocated, especially at ranges above 32K.

Your `budget_tokens` must always be less than the `max_tokens` specified.

The API response will include both thinking and text content blocks:

## Understanding thinking blocks

Thinking blocks represent Claude’s internal thought process. In order to allow Claude to work through problems with minimal internal restrictions while maintaining our safety standards and our stateless APIs, we have implemented the following:

-   Thinking blocks contain a `signature` field. This field holds a cryptographic token which verifies that the thinking block was generated by Claude, and is verified when thinking blocks are passed back to the API. When streaming responses, the signature is added via a `signature_delta` inside a `content_block_delta` event just before the `content_block_stop` event. It is only strictly necessary to send back thinking blocks when using [tool use with extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#preserving-thinking-blocks-during-tool-use). Otherwise you can omit thinking blocks from previous turns, or let the API strip them for you if you pass them back.
-   Occasionally Claude’s internal reasoning will be flagged by our safety systems. When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the `thinking` block and return it to you as a `redacted_thinking` block. These redacted thinking blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context.
-   `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks are returned before the `text` blocks in the response.

Here’s an example showing both normal and redacted thinking blocks:

When passing `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API in a multi-turn conversation, you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API for the last assistant turn.

This is critical for maintaining the model’s reasoning flow. We suggest always passing back all thinking blocks to the API. For more details, see the [Preserving thinking blocks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#preserving-thinking-blocks) section below.

### Suggestions for handling redacted thinking in production

When building customer-facing applications that use extended thinking:

-   Be aware that redacted thinking blocks contain encrypted content that isn’t human-readable
-   Consider providing a simple explanation like: “Some of Claude’s internal reasoning has been automatically encrypted for safety reasons. This doesn’t affect the quality of responses.”
-   If showing thinking blocks to users, you can filter out redacted blocks while preserving normal thinking blocks
-   Be transparent that using extended thinking features may occasionally result in some reasoning being encrypted
-   Implement appropriate error handling to gracefully manage redacted thinking without breaking your UI

## Streaming extended thinking

When streaming is enabled, you’ll receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events. Here’s how to handle streaming with thinking:

Example streaming output:

## Important considerations when using extended thinking

**Working with the thinking budget:** The minimum budget is 1,024 tokens. We suggest starting at the minimum and increasing the thinking budget incrementally to find the optimal range for Claude to perform well for your use case. Higher token counts may allow you to achieve more comprehensive and nuanced reasoning, but there may also be diminishing returns depending on the task.

-   The thinking budget is a target rather than a strict limit - actual token usage may vary based on the task.
-   Be prepared for potentially longer response times due to the additional processing required for the reasoning process.
-   Streaming is required when `max_tokens` is greater than 21,333.

**For thinking budgets above 32K:** We recommend using [batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) for workloads where the thinking budget is set above 32K to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.

**Thinking compatibility with other features:**

-   Thinking isn’t compatible with `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` modifications as well as [forced tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#forcing-tool-use).
-   You cannot pre-fill responses when thinking is enabled.
-   Changes to the thinking budget invalidate cached prompt prefixes that include messages. However, cached system prompts and tool definitions will continue to work when thinking parameters change.

### Pricing and token usage for extended thinking

Extended thinking tokens count towards the context window and are billed as output tokens. Since thinking tokens are treated as normal output tokens, they also count towards your rate limits. Be sure to account for this increased token usage when planning your API usage.

For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the pricing is:

| Token use | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Input tokens | $3 / MTok |
| Output tokens (including thinking tokens) | $15 / MTok |
| Prompt caching write | $3.75 / MTok |
| Prompt caching read | $0.30 / MTok |

[Batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) for extended thinking is available at 50% off these prices and often completes in less than 1 hour.

### Extended output capabilities (beta)

Claude 3.7 Sonnet can produce substantially longer responses than previous models with support for up to 128K output tokens (beta)—more than 15x longer than other Claude models. This expanded capability is particularly effective for extended thinking use cases involving complex reasoning, rich code generation, and comprehensive content creation.

This feature can be enabled by passing an `anthropic-beta` header of `output-128k-2025-02-19`.

When using extended thinking with longer outputs, you can allocate a larger thinking budget to support more thorough reasoning, while still having ample tokens available for the final response.

We suggest using streaming or batch mode with this extended output capability; for more details see our guidance on network reliability considerations for [long requests](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/errors#long-requests).

## Using extended thinking with prompt caching

Prompt caching with thinking has several important considerations:

**Thinking block inclusion in cached prompts**

-   Thinking is only included when generating an assistant turn and not meant to be cached.
-   Previous turn thinking blocks are ignored.
-   If thinking becomes disabled, any thinking content passed to the API is simply ignored.

**Cache invalidation rules**

-   Alterations to thinking parameters (enabling/disabling or budget changes) invalidate cache breakpoints set in messages.
-   System prompts and tools maintain caching even when thinking parameters change.

### Examples of prompt caching with extended thinking

## Max tokens and context window size with extended thinking

In older Claude models (prior to Claude 3.7 Sonnet), if the sum of prompt tokens and `max_tokens` exceeded the model’s context window, the system would automatically adjust `max_tokens` to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large `max_tokens` value and the system would silently reduce it as needed.

With Claude 3.7 Sonnet, `max_tokens` (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + `max_tokens` exceeds the context window size.

### How context window is calculated with extended thinking

When calculating context window usage with thinking enabled, there are some considerations to be aware of:

-   Thinking blocks from previous turns are stripped and not counted towards your context window
-   Current turn thinking counts towards your `max_tokens` limit for that turn

The diagram below demonstrates the specialized token management when extended thinking is enabled:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/context-window-thinking.svg)

The effective context window is calculated as:

We recommend using the [token counting API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting) to get accurate token counts for your specific use case, especially when working with multi-turn conversations that include thinking.

### Managing tokens with extended thinking

Given new context window and `max_tokens` behavior with extended thinking models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, you may need to:

-   More actively monitor and manage your token usage
-   Adjust `max_tokens` values as your prompt length changes
-   Potentially use the [token counting endpoints](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting) more frequently
-   Be aware that previous thinking blocks don’t accumulate in your context window

This change has been made to provide more predictable and transparent behavior, especially as maximum token limits have increased significantly.

When using extended thinking with tool use, be aware of the following behavior pattern:

1.  **First assistant turn**: When you send an initial user message, the assistant response will include thinking blocks followed by tool use requests.
    
2.  **Tool result turn**: When you pass the user message with tool result blocks, **the subsequent assistant message will not contain any additional thinking blocks.**
    

To expand here, the normal order of a tool use conversation with thinking follows these steps:

1.  User sends initial message
2.  Assistant responds with thinking blocks and tool requests
3.  User sends message with tool results
4.  Assistant responds with either more tool calls or just text (no thinking blocks in this response)
5.  If more tools are requested, repeat steps 3-4 until the conversation is complete

This design allows Claude to show its reasoning process before making tool requests, but not repeat the thinking process after receiving tool results. Claude will not output another thinking block until after the next non-`tool_result` `user` turn.

The diagram below illustrates the context window token management when combining extended thinking with tool use:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking and tool use](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/anthropic/images/context-window-thinking-tools.svg)

### Preserving thinking blocks

During tool use, you must pass `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API. This is critical for maintaining the model’s reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

#### Why thinking blocks must be preserved

When Claude invokes tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, Claude will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving thinking blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

1.  **Reasoning continuity**: The thinking blocks capture Claude’s step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off.
    
2.  **Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they’re part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls.
    

**Important**: When providing `thinking` or `redacted_thinking` blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive `thinking` or `redacted_thinking` blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.

## Tips for making the best use of extended thinking mode

To get the most out of extended thinking:

1.  **Set appropriate budgets**: Start with larger thinking budgets (16,000+ tokens) for complex tasks and adjust based on your needs.
    
2.  **Experiment with thinking token budgets**: The model might perform differently at different max thinking budget settings. Increasing max thinking budget can make the model think better/harder, at the tradeoff of increased latency. For critical tasks, consider testing different budget settings to find the optimal balance between quality and performance.
    
3.  **You do not need to remove previous thinking blocks yourself**: The Anthropic API automatically ignores thinking blocks from previous turns and they are not included when calculating context usage.
    
4.  **Monitor token usage**: Keep track of thinking token usage to optimize costs and performance.
    
5.  **Use extended thinking for particularly complex tasks**: Enable thinking for tasks that benefit from step-by-step reasoning like math, coding, and analysis.
    
6.  **Account for extended response time**: Factor in that generating thinking blocks may increase overall response time.
    
7.  **Handle streaming appropriately**: When streaming, be prepared to handle both thinking and text content blocks as they arrive.
    
8.  **Prompt engineering**: Review our [extended thinking prompting tips](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips) if you want to maximize Claude’s thinking capabilities.

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:

- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

## Examples

### Example: Self-correcting research summary

#### Prompt 3

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Your task is to improve a paper summary given feedback. Here is the first draft of a medical research paper:<summary>{{SUMMARY}}</summary>Here is the research paper:<paper>{{RESEARCH_PAPER}}</paper>Here is the feedback:<feedback>{{FEEDBACK}}</feedback>Update the summary based on the feedback. |
| Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.

Findings:
- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction
- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction
- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c <7%
- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss
- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss

Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.

Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.

Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

| User | Draft a strategy review document for engineering leadership based on this analysis of a multitenancy strategy.<strategy>{{STRATEGY}}</strategy><analysis>{{ANALYSIS}}</analysis>Include an executive summary, detailed analysis, and recommendations. |
| Assistant{{STRATEGY_DOC}} | # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product

## Executive Summary
The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Scalability: B+

Strengths:
- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.
- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.

Weaknesses:
- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.
- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.

### 2. Security: B-

Strengths:
- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.
- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.

Weaknesses:
- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.
- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?
- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).

### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B

Strengths:
- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.
- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.

Weaknesses:
- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.
- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.
- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.

## Recommendations

1. App Tier Resilience: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.

2. Security Hardening:
a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.
c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.

3. Cost Optimization:
a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.
b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.
c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.

4. Proof of Concept (PoC): Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:
a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.
b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.
c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.

With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

# Claude 4 prompt engineering best practices

This guide provides specific prompt engineering techniques for Claude 4 models (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) to help you achieve optimal results in your applications. These models have been trained for more precise instruction following than previous generations of Claude models.

## General principles

### Be explicit with your instructions

Claude 4 models respond well to clear, explicit instructions. Being specific about your desired output can help enhance results. Customers who desire the "above and beyond" behavior from previous Claude models might need to more explicitly request these behaviors with Claude 4.

<Accordion title="Example: Creating an analytics dashboard">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation.
  ```
</Accordion>

### Add context to improve performance

Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude 4 better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.

<Accordion title="Example: Formatting preferences">
  **Less effective:**

  ```text
  NEVER use ellipses
  ```

  **More effective:**

  ```text
  Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses since the text-to-speech engine will not know how to pronounce them.
  ```
</Accordion>

Claude is smart enough to generalize from the explanation.

### Be vigilant with examples & details

Claude 4 models pay attention to details and examples as part of instruction following. Ensure that your examples align with the behaviors you want to encourage and minimize behaviors you want to avoid.

## Guidance for specific situations

### Control the format of responses

There are a few ways that we have found to be particularly effective in steering output formatting in Claude 4 models:

1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**

   * Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"
   * Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."

2. **Use XML format indicators**

   * Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \<smoothly\_flowing\_prose\_paragraphs> tags."

3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**

   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, we recommend as best as you can matching your prompt style to your desired output style. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.

### Leverage thinking & interleaved thinking capabilities

Claude 4 offers thinking capabilities that can be especially helpful for tasks involving reflection after tool use or complex multi-step reasoning. You can guide its initial or interleaved thinking for better results.

```text Example prompt
After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
```

<Info>
  For more information on thinking capabilities, see [Extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
</Info>

### Optimize parallel tool calling

Claude 4 models excel at parallel tool execution. They have a high success rate in using parallel tool calling without any prompting to do so, but some minor prompting can boost this behavior to \~100% parallel tool use success rate. We have found this prompt to be most effective:

```text Sample prompt for agents
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
```

### Reduce file creation in agentic coding

Claude 4 models may sometimes create new files for testing and iteration purposes, particularly when working with code. This approach allows Claude to use files, especially python scripts, as a 'temporary scratchpad' before saving its final output. Using temporary files can improve outcomes particularly for agentic coding use cases.

If you'd prefer to minimize net new file creation, you can instruct Claude to clean up after itself:

```text Sample prompt
If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
```

### Enhance visual and frontend code generation

For frontend code generation, you can steer Claude 4 models to create complex, detailed, and interactive designs by providing explicit encouragement:

```text Sample prompt
Don't hold back. Give it your all.
```

You can also improve Claude's frontend performance in specific areas by providing additional modifiers and details on what to focus on:

* "Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible"
* "Add thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interactions"
* "Create an impressive demonstration showcasing web development capabilities"
* "Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement"

### Avoid focusing on passing tests and hard-coding

Frontier language models can sometimes focus too heavily on making tests pass at the expense of more general solutions. To prevent this behavior and ensure robust, generalizable solutions:

```text Sample prompt
Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.
```

## Migration considerations

When migrating from Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4:

1. **Be specific about desired behavior**: Consider describing exactly what you'd like to see in the output.

2. **Frame your instructions with modifiers**: Adding modifiers that encourage Claude to increase the quality and detail of its output can help better shape Claude's performance. For example, instead of "Create an analytics dashboard", use "Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."

3. **Request specific features explicitly**: Animations and interactive elements should be requested explicitly when desired.

# Extended thinking tips

This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of Claude's extended thinking feature. Extended thinking allows Claude to work through complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks. When you enable extended thinking, Claude shows its reasoning process before providing a final answer, giving you transparency into how it arrived at its conclusion.

See [Extended thinking models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models) for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking vs. standard thinking modes.

## Before diving in

This guide presumes that you have already decided to use extended thinking mode over standard mode and have reviewed our basic steps on [how to get started with extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#getting-started-with-claude-3-7-sonnet) as well as our [extended thinking implementation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).

### Technical considerations for extended thinking

- Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens. We recommend that you start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based on your needs and task complexity.
- For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that you use [batch processing](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
- Extended thinking performs best in English, though final outputs can be in [any language Claude supports](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/multilingual-support).
- If you need thinking below the minimum budget, we recommend using standard mode, with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML tags (like `<thinking>`). See [chain of thought prompting](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).

## Prompting techniques for extended thinking

### Use general instructions first, then troubleshoot with more step-by-step instructions

Claude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance. The model's creativity in approaching problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process.

For example, instead of:

```
User

Think through this math problem step by step: 
1. First, identify the variables
2. Then, set up the equation
3. Next, solve for x
...
```

Consider:

```
User

Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great detail. 
Consider multiple approaches and show your complete reasoning.
Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
```

That said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when needed. The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than previous versions. We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then read Claude's thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its thinking from there.

### Multishot prompting with extended thinking

[Multishot prompting](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) works well with extended thinking. When you provide Claude examples of how to think through problems, it will follow similar reasoning patterns within its extended thinking blocks.

You can include few-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by using XML tags like `<thinking>` or `<scratchpad>` to indicate canonical patterns of extended thinking in those examples.

Claude will generalize the pattern to the formal extended thinking process. However, it's possible you'll get better results by giving Claude free rein to think in the way it deems best.

Example:

```
User

I'm going to show you how to solve a math problem, then I want you to solve a similar one.

Problem 1: What is 15% of 80?

<thinking>
To find 15% of 80:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
</thinking>

The answer is 12.

Now solve this one:
Problem 2: What is 35% of 240?
```

### Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking

Claude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is enabled. The model typically:

1. Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block
2. Executes those instructions in the response

To maximize instruction following:

- Be clear and specific about what you want
- For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude should work through methodically
- Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking

### Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior

You can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claude's logic, although this method is not always perfectly reliable.

To make the best use of this methodology, we recommend the following tips:

- We don't recommend passing Claude's extended thinking back in the user text block, as this doesn't improve performance and may actually degrade results.
- Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the model's output text that follows its thinking block is likely going to degrade results due to model confusion.

When extended thinking is turned off, standard `assistant` response text [prefill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response) is still allowed.

Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text. If you want a clean response, instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the answer.

### Making the best of long outputs and longform thinking

Claude with extended thinking enabled and [extended output capabilities (beta)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/extended-thinking-models#extended-output-capabilities-beta) excels at generating large amounts of bulk data and longform text.

For dataset generation use cases, try prompts such as "Please create an extremely detailed table of…" for generating comprehensive datasets.

For use cases such as detailed content generation where you may want to generate longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses, try these tips:

- Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer outputs
- For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts down to the paragraph level. Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline and maintain the specified word counts

We do not recommend that you push Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens' sake. Rather, we encourage you to start with a small thinking budget and increase as needed to find the optimal settings for your use case.

Here are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:

#### Complex STEM problems

Complex STEM problems require Claude to build mental models, apply specialized knowledge, and work through sequential logical steps—processes that benefit from longer reasoning time.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, 
making sure to handle collision detection properly. 
Make the tesseract slowly rotate. 
Make sure the ball stays within the tesseract.
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Write a Python script for a bouncing yellow ball within a tesseract, 
making sure to handle collision detection properly. 
Make the tesseract slowly rotate. 
Make sure the ball stays within the tesseract.
This complex 4D visualization challenge makes the best use of long extended thinking time as Claude works through the mathematical and programming complexity.
```

#### Constraint optimization problems

Constraint optimization challenges Claude to satisfy multiple competing requirements simultaneously, which is best accomplished when allowing for long extended thinking time so that the model can methodically address each constraint.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with the following constraints:
- Budget of $2,500
- Must include Tokyo and Kyoto
- Need to accommodate a vegetarian diet
- Preference for cultural experiences over shopping
- Must include one day of hiking
- No more than 2 hours of travel between locations per day
- Need free time each afternoon for calls back home
- Must avoid crowds where possible
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Plan a 7-day trip to Japan with the following constraints:
- Budget of $2,500
- Must include Tokyo and Kyoto
- Need to accommodate a vegetarian diet
- Preference for cultural experiences over shopping
- Must include one day of hiking
- No more than 2 hours of travel between locations per day
- Need free time each afternoon for calls back home
- Must avoid crowds where possible
With multiple constraints to balance, Claude will naturally perform best when given more space to think through how to satisfy all requirements optimally.
```

#### Thinking frameworks

Structured thinking frameworks give Claude an explicit methodology to follow, which may work best when Claude is given long extended thinking space to follow each step.

Standard prompt:
```
User

Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft entering 
the personalized medicine market by 2027.
```

Enhanced prompt:
```
User

Develop a comprehensive strategy for Microsoft entering 
the personalized medicine market by 2027.

Begin with:
1. A Blue Ocean Strategy canvas
2. Apply Porter's Five Forces to identify competitive pressures

Next, conduct a scenario planning exercise with four 
distinct futures based on regulatory and technological variables.

For each scenario:
- Develop strategic responses using the Ansoff Matrix

Finally, apply the Three Horizons framework to:
- Map the transition pathway
- Identify potential disruptive innovations at each stage
By specifying multiple analytical frameworks that must be applied sequentially, thinking time naturally increases as Claude works through each framework methodically.
```

### Have Claude reflect on and check its work for improved consistency and error handling

You can use simple natural language prompting to improve consistency and reduce errors:

1. Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
2. Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous step achieved the expected result
3. For coding tasks, ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking

Example:

```
User

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. 
Before you finish, please verify your solution with test cases for:
- n=0
- n=1
- n=5
- n=10
And fix any issues you find.
```

# Keep Claude in character with role prompting and prefilling

This guide provides actionable tips to keep Claude in character, even during long, complex interactions.

* **Use system prompts to set the role:** Use system prompts to define Claude's role and personality. This sets a strong foundation for consistent responses.  
When setting up the character, provide detailed information about the personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks. This will help the model better emulate and generalize the character's traits.
* **Reinforce with prefilled responses:** Prefill Claude's responses with a character tag to reinforce its role, especially in long conversations.
* **Prepare Claude for possible scenarios:** Provide a list of common scenarios and expected responses in your prompts. This "trains" Claude to handle diverse situations without breaking character.

## Example: Enterprise chatbot for role prompting

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| System | You are AcmeBot, the enterprise-grade AI assistant for AcmeTechCo. Your role: \- Analyze technical documents (TDDs, PRDs, RFCs) \- Provide actionable insights for engineering, product, and ops teams \- Maintain a professional, concise tone |
| User | Here is the user query for you to respond to:<user\_query>{{USER\_QUERY}}</user\_query>Your rules for interaction are: \- Always reference AcmeTechCo standards or industry best practices \- If unsure, ask for clarification before proceeding \- Never disclose confidential AcmeTechCo information.As AcmeBot, you should handle situations along these guidelines: \- If asked about AcmeTechCo IP: "I cannot disclose TechCo's proprietary information." \- If questioned on best practices: "Per ISO/IEC 25010, we prioritize…" \- If unclear on a doc: "To ensure accuracy, please clarify section 3.2…" |

# Let Claude think (chain of thought prompting) to increase performance

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

## Before implementing CoT

### Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

### Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.

---

## How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.  
   * Lacks guidance on _how_ to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think step-by-step before you write the email. |

* **Guided prompt**: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.  
   * Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the thinking.

Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think before you write the email. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email using your analysis. |

* **Structured prompt**: Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.

Example: Writing donor emails (structured guided CoT)  
| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | Draft personalized emails to donors asking for contributions to this year's Care for Kids program.Program information:<program>{{PROGRAM_DETAILS}}</program>Donor information:<donor>{{DONOR_DETAILS}}</donor>Think before you write the email in <thinking> tags. First, think through what messaging might appeal to this donor given their donation history and which campaigns they've supported in the past. Then, think through what aspects of the Care for Kids program would appeal to them, given their history. Finally, write the personalized donor email in <email> tags, using your analysis. |

### Examples

Example: Financial analysis without thinking

Without step-by-step thinking, Claude gives a recommendation that seems reasonable but lacks depth. It doesn't quantify the potential outcomes or consider historical market performance, which are crucial for making an informed decision.

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? |
| Assistant | Based on the information provided, I would recommend option B, the bond that guarantees a 6% annual return. Here's why:1. Certainty: The bond offers a guaranteed 6% annual return, which provides certainty in financial planning. This is crucial when the client has a specific financial goal (down payment) with a fixed timeline (5 years).2. Risk aversion: Since the client needs this money for an important life event (buying a house), they likely have a low risk tolerance. The volatility of the stock market could jeopardize their plans if there's a downturn close to when they need the funds.3. Time horizon: With only 5 years, there's less time to recover from potential stock market downturns. Longer investment horizons (10+ years) are generally better suited for weathering stock market volatility.While the stock's historical 12% return is attractive, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The guaranteed 6% from the bond ensures the client will have the funds they need when it's time to make the down payment. |

Example: Financial analysis with thinking

With step-by-step thinking, the advisor provides a much richer analysis. It calculates exact figures for both scenarios, considers historical market volatility, and deeply analyzes the client's risk tolerance. This thorough reasoning leads to a more confident and justifiable recommendation.

| Role | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| User | You're a financial advisor. A client wants to invest $10,000. They can choose between two options: A) A stock that historically returns 12% annually but is volatile, or B) A bond that guarantees 6% annually. The client needs the money in 5 years for a down payment on a house. Which option do you recommend? Think step-by-step. |
| Assistant | To determine the best investment option for our client, I'll consider several factors step-by-step:<thinking>1. Understand the client's goal and timeline:- Goal: Down payment for a house- Timeline: 5 years- Implication: This is a short-term, high-priority financial goal. The client likely cannot afford significant risk or volatility.2. Analyze Option A (Stock):- Pro: Higher historical return (12% annually)- Con: Volatile (implying potential for significant gains or losses)- Calculate potential 5-year return:- Best case (12% annually): $10,000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ $17,623.42- Worst case (market crash): Could lose a substantial portion, e.g., 50% crash = $5,0003. Analyze Option B (Bond):- Pro: Guaranteed return (6% annually)- Con: Lower return compared to historical stock performance- Calculate 5-year return:- Guaranteed: $10,000 * (1.06)^5 ≈ $13,382.254. Consider risk tolerance:- Goal is a house down payment (essential, not discretionary)- Short timeline (5 years) limits ability to recover from market downturns- Conclusion: Client likely has low risk tolerance5. Historical perspective:- Stock's 12% is historical, not guaranteed- In 5-year periods, stock market can vary wildly:- 2003-2007 (pre-financial crisis): S&P 500 up ~82%- 2007-2011 (during crisis): S&P 500 down ~2%- Conclusion: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, especially short-term6. Final analysis:- Option A (Stock): Higher potential return but unacceptable risk of not meeting the down payment goal- Option B (Bond): Guaranteed to meet ~80% of best-case stock scenario, 100% certainty of having funds</thinking><answer>I recommend Option B, the bond with a guaranteed 6% annual return. While the stock's historical 12% return is tempting, the bond ensures you'll have $13,382.25 in 5 years for your house down payment. Given the importance and short timeline of your goal, the stock's volatility poses an unacceptable risk. The bond provides certainty, which is invaluable for such a crucial financial milestone.</answer> |

# Long context prompting tips

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Claude's extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. This guide will help you leverage this power effectively.

## Essential tips for long context prompts

* **Put longform data at the top**: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.  
Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.

* **Structure document content and metadata with XML tags**: When using multiple documents, wrap each document in `<document>` tags with `<document_content>` and `<source>` (and other metadata) subtags for clarity.  

Example multi-document structure  
```xml
<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
    <document_content>
      {{ANNUAL_REPORT}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
    <document_content>
      {{COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS}}
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>
Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
```

* **Ground responses in quotes**: For long document tasks, ask Claude to quote relevant parts of the documents first before carrying out its task. This helps Claude cut through the "noise" of the rest of the document's contents.  

Example quote extraction  
```xml
You are an AI physician's assistant. Your task is to help doctors diagnose possible patient illnesses.

<documents>
  <document index="1">

# Prefill Claude's response for greater output control

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Prefilling is only available for non-extended thinking modes. It's not currently supported with extended thinking.

When using Claude, you have the unique ability to guide its responses by prefilling the `Assistant` message. This powerful technique allows you to direct Claude's actions, skip preambles, enforce specific formats like JSON or XML, and even help Claude maintain character consistency in role-play scenarios.

In some cases where Claude is not performing as expected, a few prefilled sentences can vastly improve Claude's performance. A little prefilling goes a long way!

## How to prefill Claude's response

To prefill, include the desired initial text in the `Assistant` message (Claude's response will continue from where the `Assistant` message leaves off):

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favorite color?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI assistant, I don't have a favorite color, But if I had to pick, it would be green because"}  # Prefill here
    ]
)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Controlling output formatting and skipping the preamble

**Power user tip**: Prefilling `{` forces Claude to skip the preamble and directly output the JSON object. This is cleaner, more concise, and easier for programs to parse without additional processing.

#### Example: Structured data extraction without prefilling

| Role      | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Example 2: Maintaining character in roleplay scenarios

**Role-play tip**: Prefilling a bracketed `[ROLE_NAME]` can remind Claude stay in character, even for longer and more complex conversations. This is especially powerful when combined with role prompting in the `system` parameter.

#### Example: Maintaining character without role prompting

| Role                                                          | Content                                                                                                                   |

| Assistant (Claude's response)                                 | Ah, what have we here? A most curious specimen, Watson! Let us examine this shoe with a discerning eye. The mud, you see, is not your common London clay, but rather the distinctive reddish hue of the iron-rich soil found only in the environs of Hampstead Heath. And yet, the wear on the sole suggests a gait more suited to the cobblestones of Whitechapel than the gentle slopes of the Heath.Now, observe the laces! They are tied with a particular knot favored by those in the medical profession—doubtless a habit acquired during years of tying surgical gowns. But the scuff marks on the toe box tell a different tale: they are consistent with the kicking motion one might employ in the martial arts, specifically Baritsu.We may conclude, then, that our absent shoe owner is a doctor, possibly a surgeon, who resides in Whitechapel but frequents Hampstead Heath—perhaps for a secret Baritsu practice, away from prying eyes. A most intriguing case, Watson! We must make haste; the game is afoot! |

# Reduce hallucinations

Even the most advanced language models, like Claude, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or inconsistent with the given context. This phenomenon, known as "hallucination," can undermine the reliability of your AI-driven solutions. This guide will explore techniques to minimize hallucinations and ensure Claude's outputs are accurate and trustworthy.

## Basic hallucination minimization strategies

- **Allow Claude to say "I don't know":** Explicitly give Claude permission to admit uncertainty. This simple technique can drastically reduce false information.

    Example: Analyzing a merger & acquisition report

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | As our M&A advisor, analyze this report on the potential acquisition of AcmeCo by ExampleCorp.<report>{{REPORT}}</report>Focus on financial projections, integration risks, and regulatory hurdles. If you're unsure about any aspect or if the report lacks necessary information, say "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this." |

- **Use direct quotes for factual grounding:** For tasks involving long documents (>20K tokens), ask Claude to extract word-for-word quotes first before performing its task. This grounds its responses in the actual text, reducing hallucinations.

    Example: Auditing a data privacy policy

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | As our Data Protection Officer, review this updated privacy policy for GDPR and CCPA compliance.<policy>{{POLICY}}</policy>1. Extract exact quotes from the policy that are most relevant to GDPR and CCPA compliance. If you can't find relevant quotes, state "No relevant quotes found."2. Use the quotes to analyze the compliance of these policy sections, referencing the quotes by number. Only base your analysis on the extracted quotes. |

- **Verify with citations**: Make Claude's response auditable by having it cite quotes and sources for each of its claims. You can also have Claude verify each claim by finding a supporting quote after it generates a response. If it can't find a quote, it must retract the claim.

    Example: Drafting a press release on a product launch

    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | Draft a press release for our new cybersecurity product, AcmeSecurity Pro, using only information from these product briefs and market reports.<documents>{{DOCUMENTS}}</documents>After drafting, review each claim in your press release. For each claim, find a direct quote from the documents that supports it. If you can't find a supporting quote for a claim, remove that claim from the press release and mark where it was removed with empty [] brackets. |

## Advanced techniques

- **Chain-of-thought verification**: Ask Claude to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This can reveal faulty logic or assumptions.

- **Best-of-N verification**: Run Claude through the same prompt multiple times and compare the outputs. Inconsistencies across outputs could indicate hallucinations.

- **Iterative refinement**: Use Claude's outputs as inputs for follow-up prompts, asking it to verify or expand on previous statements. This can catch and correct inconsistencies.

- **External knowledge restriction**: Explicitly instruct Claude to only use information from provided documents and not its general knowledge.

**Remember**, while these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, they don't eliminate them entirely. Always validate critical information, especially for high-stakes decisions.

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs. This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.

## Why use examples?

* **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
* **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
* **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:

* **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
* **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
* **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.

## Example: Analyzing customer feedback

Notice that in the "no examples" version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.

# Use XML tags to structure your prompts

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models here.

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

## Why use XML tags?

* **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
* **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
* **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
* **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.

## Tagging best practices

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2. **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.

## Examples

### Example: Generating financial reports

Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn't match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.

| Assistant | The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. | <findings>1\. Indemnification (Clause 8): \- Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against "any and all claims" arising from our use. \- Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor's negligence or product defects. \- Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.2\. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9): \- Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages. \- Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions. \- Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.3\. IP Ownership (Clause 12): \- Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations. \- Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights. \- Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.4\. Unusual Terms: \- Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for "any purpose." \- Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for "convenience" with only 7 days' notice. \- Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.</findings><recommendations>1\. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.2\. Counter-propose: \- Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement. \- Liability: Cap at 12 months' fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect. \- IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations. \- Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only. \- Termination: Minimum 90 days' notice; only for cause. \- Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.3\. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions.4\. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes.</recommendations> |

# Troubleshooting

> Discover solutions to common issues with Claude Code installation and usage.

## Common installation issues

### Linux permission issues

When installing Claude Code with npm, you may encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (eg. `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Create a user-writable npm prefix

The safest approach is to configure npm to use a directory within your home folder:

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
```

This solution is recommended because it:

- Avoids modifying system directory permissions
- Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
- Follows security best practices

#### System Recovery: If you have run commands that change ownership and permissions of system files or similar

If you've already run a command that changed system directory permissions (such as `sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn) /usr && sudo chmod -R u+w /usr`) and your system is now broken (for example, if you see `sudo: /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set`), you'll need to perform recovery steps.

##### Ubuntu/Debian Recovery Method:

1. While rebooting, hold **SHIFT** to access the GRUB menu

2. Select "Advanced options for Ubuntu/Debian"

3. Choose the recovery mode option

4. Select "Drop to root shell prompt"

5. Remount the filesystem as writable:

   ```bash
   mount -o remount,rw /
   ```

6. Fix permissions:

   ```bash
   # Restore root ownership
   chown -R root:root /usr
   chmod -R 755 /usr

   # Ensure /usr/local is owned by your user for npm packages
   chown -R YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_USERNAME /usr/local

   # Set setuid bit for critical binaries
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/su
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/passwd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/newgrp
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/gpasswd
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chsh
   chmod u+s /usr/bin/chfn

   # Fix sudo configuration
   chown root:root /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chmod 4755 /usr/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
   chown root:root /etc/sudo.conf
   chmod 644 /etc/sudo.conf
   ```

7. Reinstall affected packages (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   # Save list of installed packages
   dpkg --get-selections > /tmp/installed_packages.txt

   # Reinstall them
   awk '{print $1}' /tmp/installed_packages.txt | xargs -r apt-get install --reinstall -y
   ```

8. Reboot:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

##### Alternative Live USB Recovery Method:

If the recovery mode doesn't work, you can use a live USB:

1. Boot from a live USB (Ubuntu, Debian, or any Linux distribution)

2. Find your system partition:

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

3. Mount your system partition:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt  # replace sdXY with your actual system partition
   ```

4. If you have a separate boot partition, mount it too:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot  # if needed
   ```

5. Chroot into your system:

   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo chroot /mnt

   # For Arch-based systems:
   sudo arch-chroot /mnt
   ```

6. Follow steps 6-8 from the Ubuntu/Debian recovery method above

After restoring your system, follow the recommended solution above to set up a user-writable npm prefix.

## Auto-updater issues

If Claude Code can't update automatically, it may be due to permission issues with your npm global prefix directory. Follow the [recommended solution](#recommended-solution-create-a-user-writable-npm-prefix) above to fix this.

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead, you can
set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` [environment variable](settings#environment-variables) to `1`

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### ESC key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the ESC key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Click the "Configure terminal keybindings" hyperlink next to "Override IDE Shortcuts"
3. Within the terminal keybindings, scroll down to "Switch focus to Editor" and delete that shortcut

This will allow the ESC key to properly function for canceling Claude Code operations instead of being captured by PyCharm's "Switch focus to Editor" action.

## Getting more help

If you're experiencing issues not covered here:

1. Use the `/bug` command within Claude Code to report problems directly to Anthropic
2. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) for known issues
3. Run `/doctor` to check the health of your Claude Code installation

# Identity and Access Management

> Learn how to configure user authentication, authorization, and access controls for Claude Code in your organization.

## Authentication methods

Setting up Claude Code requires access to Anthropic models. For teams, you can set up Claude Code access in one of three ways:

- Anthropic API via the Anthropic Console
- Amazon Bedrock
- Google Vertex AI

### Anthropic API authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Anthropic API:**

1. Use your existing Anthropic Console account or create a new Anthropic Console account
2. You can add users through either method below:
   - Bulk invite users from within the Console (Console -> Settings -> Members -> Invite)
   - [Set up SSO](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10280258-setting-up-single-sign-on-on-the-api-console)
3. When inviting users, they need one of the following roles:
   - "Claude Code" role means users can only create Claude Code API keys
   - "Developer" role means users can create any kind of API key
4. Each invited user needs to complete these steps:
   - Accept the Console invite
   - [Check system requirements](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#system-requirements)
   - [Install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)
   - Login with Console account credentials

### Cloud provider authentication

**To set up Claude Code access for your team via Bedrock or Vertex:**

1. Follow the [Bedrock docs](/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock) or [Vertex docs](/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai)
2. Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](/en/docs/claude-code/settings).
3. Users can [install Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup#installation)

## Access control and permissions

We support fine-grained permissions so that you're able to specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do (e.g. run tests, run linter) and what it is not allowed to do (e.g. update cloud infrastructure). These permission settings can be checked into version control and distributed to all developers in your organization, as well as customized by individual developers.

### Permission system

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type         | Example              | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior               |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only         | File reads, LS, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |
| Bash Commands     | Shell execution      | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files     | Yes               | Until session end                             |

### Configuring permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

- **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without further manual approval.
- **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.
- **Additional directories** extend Claude's file access to directories beyond the initial working directory.
- **Default mode** controls Claude's permission behavior when encountering new requests.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matches any use of that tool. For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use the Bash tool without requiring user approval.

#### Permission modes

Claude Code supports several permission modes that can be set as the `defaultMode` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files):

| Mode                | Description                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard behavior - prompts for permission on first use of each tool         |
| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

- **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
- **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
- **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls. For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

**Bash**

- `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
- `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`
</Tip>

**Read & Edit**

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home directory, use `~/`.

- `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
- `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
- `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

**WebFetch**

- `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

- `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
- `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

### Enterprise managed policy settings

For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we support enterprise managed policy settings that take precedence over user and project settings. This allows system administrators to enforce security policies that users cannot override.

System administrators can deploy policies to:

- **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- **Linux and Windows (via WSL)**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

These policy files follow the same format as regular [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files) but cannot be overridden by user or project settings. This ensures consistent security policies across your organization.

### Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

### Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

## Credential management

Claude Code supports authentication via Claude.ai credentials, Anthropic API credentials, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth. On macOS, the API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored on encrypted macOS Keychain. Alternately, the setting [apiKeyHelper](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings) can be set to a shell script which returns an API key. By default, this helper is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response; specifying environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` defines a custom refresh interval.

| `acceptEdits`       | Automatically accepts file edit permissions for the session                  |
| `plan`              | Plan mode - Claude can analyze but not modify files or execute commands      |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skips all permission prompts (requires safe environment - see warning below) |

#### Working directories

By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where it was launched. You can extend this access:

- **During startup**: Use `--add-dir <path>` CLI argument
- **During session**: Use `/add-dir` slash command
- **Persistent configuration**: Add to `additionalDirectories` in [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files)

Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory - they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.

#### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls. For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

**Bash**

- `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
- `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd && other-cmd`
</Tip>

**Read & Edit**

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home directory, use `~/`.

- `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
- `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
- `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

**WebFetch**

- `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

**MCP**

- `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
- `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

### Enterprise managed policy settings

For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we support enterprise managed policy settings that take precedence over user and project settings. This allows system administrators to enforce security policies that users cannot override.

System administrators can deploy policies to:

- **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- **Linux and Windows (via WSL)**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

These policy files follow the same format as regular [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-files) but cannot be overridden by user or project settings. This ensures consistent security policies across your organization.

### Settings precedence

When multiple settings sources exist, they are applied in the following order (highest to lowest precedence):

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing flexibility at the project and user levels where appropriate.

### Additional permission control with hooks

[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) provide a way to register custom shell commands to perform permission evaluation at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission system runs, and the hook output can determine whether to approve or deny the tool call in place of the permission system.

## Credential management

Claude Code supports authentication via Claude.ai credentials, Anthropic API credentials, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth. On macOS, the API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials are stored on encrypted macOS Keychain. Alternately, the setting [apiKeyHelper](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings) can be set to a shell script which returns an API key. By default, this helper is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response; specifying environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` defines a custom refresh interval.

# Manage costs effectively

> Learn how to track and optimize token usage and costs when using Claude Code.

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is \$6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below \$12 for 90% of users.

For team usage, Claude Code charges by API token consumption. On average, Claude Code costs \~\$50-60/developer per month with Sonnet 4 though there is large variance depending on how many instances users are running and whether they're using it in automation.

## Track your costs

- Use `/cost` to see current session usage
- **Anthropic Console users**:
  - Check [historical usage](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console) in the Anthropic Console (requires Admin or Billing role)
  - Set [workspace spend limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces) for the Claude Code workspace (requires Admin role)
- **Pro and Max plan users**: Usage is included in your subscription

## Managing costs for teams

When using Anthropic API, you can limit the total Claude Code workspace spend. To configure, [follow these instructions](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces). Admins can view cost and usage reporting by [following these instructions](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console).

On Bedrock and Vertex, Claude Code does not send metrics from your cloud. In order to get cost metrics, several large enterprises reported using [LiteLLM](/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex-proxies#litellm), which is an open-source tool that helps companies [track spend by key](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/virtual_keys#tracking-spend). This project is unaffiliated with Anthropic and we have not audited its security.

## Reduce token usage

- **Compact conversations:**
  - Claude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity
  - Toggle auto-compact: Run `/config` and navigate to "Auto-compact enabled"
  - Use `/compact` manually when context gets large
  - Add custom instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`
  - Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:

    ```markdown
    # Summary instructions

    When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes
    ```

- **Write specific queries:** Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning

- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into focused interactions

- **Clear history between tasks:** Use `/clear` to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:

- Size of codebase being analyzed
- Complexity of queries
- Number of files being searched or modified
- Length of conversation history
- Frequency of compacting conversations
- Background processes (haiku generation, conversation summarization)

## Background token usage

Claude Code uses tokens for some background functionality even when idle:

- **Haiku generation**: Small creative messages that appear while you type (approximately 1 cent per day)
- **Conversation summarization**: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the `claude --resume` feature
- **Command processing**: Some commands like `/cost` may generate requests to check status

These background processes consume a small amount of tokens (typically under \$0.04 per session) even without active interaction.

<Note>
  For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to
  establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<prefix>:<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                         |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<prefix>`       | Command scope (`project` for project-specific, `user` for personal) |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension)   |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                            |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/project:`

In the following example, we create the `/project:optimize` command:

```bash
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`\
**Prefix**: `/user:`

In the following example, we create the `/user:security-review` command:

```bash
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Organize commands in subdirectories to create namespaced commands.

**Structure**: `<prefix>:<namespace>:<command>`

For example, a file at `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates the command `/project:frontend:component`

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

For example:

```bash
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /project:fix-issue 123
```

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context.

For example:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### File format

Command files support:

- **Markdown format** (`.md` extension)
- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata:
  - `allowed-tools`: List of tools the command can use
  - `description`: Brief description of the command
- **Dynamic content** with bash commands (`!`) and file references (`@`)
- **Prompt instructions** as the main content

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

- An MCP server is connected and active
- The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
- The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

- Server and prompt names are normalized
- Spaces and special characters become underscores
- Names are lowercased for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

- View all configured MCP servers
- Check connection status
- Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
- Clear authentication tokens
- View available tools and prompts from each server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an image to the conversation">
    You can use any of these methods:

    1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
    2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
    3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., "Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Claude to analyze the image">
    ```
    > What does this image show?
    ```

    ```
    > Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
    ```

    ```
    > Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use images for context">
    ```
    > Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?

## Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference a single file">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```

    This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a directory">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```

    This provides a directory listing with file information.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference MCP resources">
    ```
    > Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
    ```

    This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- File paths can be relative or absolute
- @ file references add CLAUDE.md in the file's directory and parent directories to context
- Directory references show file listings, not contents
- You can reference multiple files in a single message (e.g., "@file1.js and @file2.js")
  </Tip>

## Use extended thinking

Suppose you're working on complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, or planning multi-step implementations that require deep reasoning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide context and ask Claude to think">
    ```
    > I need to implement a new authentication system using OAuth2 for our API. Think deeply about the best approach for implementing this in our codebase.
    ```

    Claude will gather relevant information from your codebase and
    use extended thinking, which will be visible in the interface.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine the thinking with follow-up prompts">
    ```
    > think about potential security vulnerabilities in this approach
    ```

    ```
    > think harder about edge cases we should handle
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips to get the most value out of extended thinking:

Extended thinking is most valuable for complex tasks such as:

- Planning complex architectural changes
- Debugging intricate issues
- Creating implementation plans for new features
- Understanding complex codebases
- Evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches

The way you prompt for thinking results in varying levels of thinking depth:

- "think" triggers basic extended thinking
- intensifying phrases such as "think more", "think a lot", "think harder", or "think longer" triggers deeper thinking

For more extended thinking prompting tips, see [Extended thinking tips](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

## Resume previous conversations

Suppose you've been working on a task with Claude Code and need to continue where you left off in a later session.

Claude Code provides two options for resuming previous conversations:

- `--continue` to automatically continue the most recent conversation
- `--resume` to display a conversation picker

<Steps>
  <Step title="Continue the most recent conversation">
    ```bash
    claude --continue
    ```

    This immediately resumes your most recent conversation without any prompts.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue in non-interactive mode">
    ```bash
    claude --continue --print "Continue with my task"
    ```

    Use `--print` with `--continue` to resume the most recent conversation in non-interactive mode, perfect for scripts or automation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Show conversation picker">
    ```bash
    claude --resume
    ```

    This displays an interactive conversation selector showing:

    * Conversation start time
    * Initial prompt or conversation summary
    * Message count

    Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select a conversation.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Conversation history is stored locally on your machine
- Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation
- Use `--resume` when you need to select a specific past conversation
- When resuming, you'll see the entire conversation history before continuing
- The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

How it works:

1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact

Examples:

```bash
# Continue most recent conversation
claude --continue

# Continue most recent conversation with a specific prompt
claude --continue --print "Show me our progress"

# Show conversation picker
claude --resume

# Continue most recent conversation in non-interactive mode
claude --continue --print "Run the tests again"
```

</Tip>

## Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Git worktrees">
    Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
    repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
    directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
    more in the [official Git worktree
    documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new worktree">
    ```bash
    # Create a new worktree with a new branch
    git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

    # Or create a worktree with an existing branch
    git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
    ```

    This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude Code in each worktree">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your worktree
    cd ../project-feature-a

    # Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
    claude
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude in another worktree">
    ```bash
    cd ../project-bugfix
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your worktrees">
    ```bash
    # List all worktrees
    git worktree list

    # Remove a worktree when done
    git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
- Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
- All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
- For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
- Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
- Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project's setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
  _ JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
  _ Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers \* Other languages: Following your project's standard setup process
  </Tip>

## Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.

**Add Claude to your build script:**

```json
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
- Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
- Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification
  </Tip>

### Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.

**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
- Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
- Consider using --output-format for structured output
  </Tip>

### Control output format

Suppose you need Claude's output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use text format (default)">
    ```bash
    cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
    ```

    This outputs just Claude's plain text response (default behavior).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
    ```

    This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use streaming JSON format">
    ```bash
    cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
    ```

    This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude's response
- Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
- Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn
  </Tip>

## Create custom slash commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks.

For more details, see the [Slash commands](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) reference page.

### Create project-specific commands

Suppose you want to create reusable slash commands for your project that all team members can use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your project">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your custom command in Claude Code">
    ```
    > /project:optimize
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Command names are derived from the filename (e.g., `optimize.md` becomes `/project:optimize`)
- You can organize commands in subdirectories (e.g., `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` becomes `/project:frontend:component`)
- Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository
- The Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked
  </Tip>

### Add command arguments with \$ARGUMENTS

Suppose you want to create flexible slash commands that can accept additional input from users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a command file with the $ARGUMENTS placeholder">
    ```bash
    echo "Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps: 1.
    Understand the issue described in the ticket 2. Locate the relevant code in
    our codebase 3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause 4. Add
    appropriate tests 5. Prepare a concise PR description" >
    .claude/commands/fix-issue.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the command with an issue number">
    In your Claude session, use the command with arguments.

    ```
    > /project:fix-issue 123
    ```

    This will replace \$ARGUMENTS with "123" in the prompt.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The \$ARGUMENTS placeholder is replaced with any text that follows the command
- You can position \$ARGUMENTS anywhere in your command template
- Other useful applications: generating test cases for specific functions, creating documentation for components, reviewing code in particular files, or translating content to specified languages
  </Tip>

### Create personal slash commands

Suppose you want to create personal slash commands that work across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your home folder">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash
    echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" >
    ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your personal custom command">
    ```
    > /user:security-review
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Personal commands are prefixed with `/user:` instead of `/project:`
- Personal commands are only available to you and not shared with your team
- Personal commands work across all your projects
- You can use these for consistent workflows across different codebases
  </Tip>

**Custom Slash Commands:**

- **Project commands**: `.claude/commands/`, prefix `/project:`
- **Personal commands**: `~/.claude/commands/`, prefix `/user:`
- **Arguments**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.
- **Bash execution**: Use `!` prefix.
- **File references**: Use `@` prefix.

### 3.4. Memory Management (`CLAUDE.md`)

Claude remembers preferences and project context via `CLAUDE.md` files.

**Memory Locations:**

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences (deprecated) |

**Features:**

- **Imports**: Use `@path/to/import` to include other files.
- **Recursive lookup**: Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` files from the current directory up to the root.
- **Quick add**: Start input with `#` to add a memory.
- **Direct edit**: Use `/memory` to edit memory files.

## 4. Common Workflows

- **Understand new codebases**: Ask for overviews, architecture patterns, and data models.
- **Fix bugs**: Share error messages and ask for fix recommendations.
- **Refactor code**: Identify legacy code and get refactoring suggestions.
- **Work with tests**: Identify untested code and generate test cases.
- **Create pull requests**: Summarize changes and generate PR descriptions.
- **Handle documentation**: Find undocumented code and generate comments.
- **Work with images**: Analyze screenshots, diagrams, and mockups.
- **Reference files and directories**: Use `@` to include file content or directory listings.
- **Use extended thinking**: Use "think", "think hard", etc., for complex tasks.
- **Resume conversations**: Use `--continue` or `--resume`.
- **Parallel sessions**: Use Git worktrees for isolated environments.
- **Unix-style utility**: Pipe data in and out, control output format.

## 5. Advanced Features

### 5.1. Claude Code SDK

Integrate Claude Code programmatically into your applications.

- **Authentication**: Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or configure for Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.
- **Command line**: `claude -p "prompt"`

[View repository →](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action)

## Setup

## Quick setup

The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

<Note>
  * You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
  * This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. If you're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the [Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI](#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai) section.
</Note>

## Manual setup

If the `/install-github-app` command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:

1. **Install the Claude GitHub app** to your repository: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
2. **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions))
3. **Copy the workflow file** from [examples/claude.yml](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

<Tip>
  After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging `@claude` in an issue or PR comment!
</Tip>

## Example use cases

Claude Code GitHub Actions can help you with a variety of tasks. For complete working examples, see the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples).

### Turn issues into PRs

In an issue comment:

```
@claude implement this feature based on the issue description
```

Claude will analyze the issue, write the code, and create a PR for review.

### Get implementation help

In a PR comment:

```
@claude how should I implement user authentication for this endpoint?
```

Claude will analyze your code and provide specific implementation guidance.

### Fix bugs quickly

In an issue:

```yaml
@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component
```

Claude will locate the bug, implement a fix, and create a PR.

## Best practices

### CLAUDE.md configuration

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude's understanding of your project standards.

### Security considerations

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys directly to your repository!
</Warning>

Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:

- Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Reference it in workflows: `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`
- Limit action permissions to only what's necessary
- Review Claude's suggestions before merging

Always use GitHub Secrets (e.g., `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.

### Optimizing performance

Use issue templates to provide context, keep your `CLAUDE.md` concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.

### CI costs

When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs:

**GitHub Actions costs:**

- Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
- See [GitHub's billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for detailed pricing and minute limits

**API costs:**

- Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
- Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
- See [Claude's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/api) for current token rates

**Cost optimization tips:**

- Use specific `@claude` commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Configure appropriate `max_turns` limits to prevent excessive iterations
- Set reasonable `timeout_minutes` to avoid runaway workflows
- Consider using GitHub's concurrency controls to limit parallel runs

## Configuration examples

For ready-to-use workflow configurations for different use cases, including:

- Basic workflow setup for issue and PR comments
- Automated code reviews on pull requests
- Custom implementations for specific needs

Visit the [examples directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) in the Claude Code Action repository.

<Tip>
  The examples repository includes complete, tested workflows that you can copy directly into your `.github/workflows/` directory.
</Tip>

## Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI

For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:

#### For Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
2. Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
3. A service account with the required permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

#### For AWS Bedrock:

1. An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
2. GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
3. An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
4. A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)">
    For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:

    1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps/new](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
    2. Fill in the basic information:
       * **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name (e.g., "YourOrg Claude Assistant")
       * **Homepage URL**: Your organization's website or the repository URL
    3. Configure the app settings:
       * **Webhooks**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed for this integration)
    4. Set the required permissions:
       * **Repository permissions**:
         * Contents: Read & Write
         * Issues: Read & Write
         * Pull requests: Read & Write
    5. Click "Create GitHub App"
    6. After creation, click "Generate a private key" and save the downloaded `.pem` file
    7. Note your App ID from the app settings page
    8. Install the app to your repository:
       * From your app's settings page, click "Install App" in the left sidebar
       * Select your account or organization
       * Choose "Only select repositories" and select the specific repository
       * Click "Install"
    9. Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
       * Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
       * Create a new secret named `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with the contents of the `.pem` file
    10. Add the App ID as a secret:

    * Create a new secret named `APP_ID` with your GitHub App's ID

    <Note>
      This app will be used with the [actions/create-github-app-token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.
    </Note>

    **Alternative for Anthropic API or if you don't want to setup your own Github app**: Use the official Anthropic app:

    1. Install from: [https://github.com/apps/claude](https://github.com/apps/claude)
    2. No additional configuration needed for authentication

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure cloud provider authentication">
    Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="AWS Bedrock">
        **Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable Amazon Bedrock**:
           * Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
           * For cross-region models, request access in all required regions

        2. **Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider**:
           * Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`

        3. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
           * Trusted entity type: Web identity
           * Identity provider: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
           * Permissions: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy
           * Configure trust policy for your specific repository

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **AWS\_ROLE\_TO\_ASSUME**: The ARN of the IAM role you created

        <Tip>
          OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.
        </Tip>

        See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for detailed OIDC setup instructions.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Google Vertex AI">
        **Configure Google Cloud to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.**

        > **Security Note**: Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.

        **Required Setup**:

        1. **Enable APIs** in your Google Cloud project:
           * IAM Credentials API
           * Security Token Service (STS) API
           * Vertex AI API

        2. **Create Workload Identity Federation resources**:
           * Create a Workload Identity Pool
           * Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
             * Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
             * Attribute mappings for repository and owner
             * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific attribute conditions

        3. **Create a Service Account**:
           * Grant only `Vertex AI User` role
           * **Security recommendation**: Create a dedicated service account per repository

        4. **Configure IAM bindings**:
           * Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
           * **Security recommendation**: Use repository-specific principal sets

        **Required Values**:

        After setup, you'll need:

        * **GCP\_WORKLOAD\_IDENTITY\_PROVIDER**: The full provider resource name
        * **GCP\_SERVICE\_ACCOUNT**: The service account email address

        <Tip>
          Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.
        </Tip>

        For detailed setup instructions, consult the [Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not responding to @claude commands

Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains `@claude` (not `/claude`).

### CI not running on Claude's commits

Ensure you're using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.

### Authentication errors

Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.

## Advanced configuration

### Action parameters

The Claude Code Action supports these key parameters:

| Parameter           | Description                    | Required |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `prompt`            | The prompt to send to Claude   | Yes\*    |
| `prompt_file`       | Path to file containing prompt | Yes\*    |
| `anthropic_api_key` | Anthropic API key              | Yes\*\*  |
| `max_turns`         | Maximum conversation turns     | No       |
| `timeout_minutes`   | Execution timeout              | No       |

\*Either `prompt` or `prompt_file` required\
\*\*Required for direct Anthropic API, not for Bedrock/Vertex

### Alternative integration methods

While the `/install-github-app` command is the recommended approach, you can also:

- **Custom GitHub App**: For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
- **Manual GitHub Actions**: Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
- **MCP Configuration**: Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers

See the [Claude Code Action repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) for detailed documentation.

### Customizing Claude's behavior

You can configure Claude's behavior in two ways:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our [Memory documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/memory) for more details.
2. **Custom prompts**: Use the `prompt` parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude's behavior for different workflows or tasks.

Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.

# Hooks

> Customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

# Introduction

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

Example use cases include:

- **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
- **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
- **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
- **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
- **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  Hooks execute shell commands with your full user permissions without
  confirmation. You are responsible for ensuring your hooks are safe and secure.
  Anthropic is not liable for any data loss or system damage resulting from hook
  usage. Review [Security Considerations](#security-considerations).
</Warning>

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

Quickstart Prerequisite: Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press Esc until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered!

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured in your
[settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings):

- `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
- `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
- Enterprise managed policy settings

### Structure

Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names (only applicable for `PreToolUse` and
  `PostToolUse`)
  - Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
  - Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
  - If omitted or empty string, hooks run for all matching events
- **hooks**: Array of commands to execute when the pattern matches
  - `type`: Currently only `"command"` is supported
  - `command`: The bash command to execute
  - `timeout`: (Optional) How long a command should run, in seconds, before
    canceling all in-progress hooks.

## Hook Events

### PreToolUse

Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.

**Common matchers:**

- `Task` - Agent tasks
- `Bash` - Shell commands
- `Glob` - File pattern matching
- `Grep` - Content search
- `Read` - File reading
- `Edit`, `MultiEdit` - File editing
- `Write` - File writing
- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

### PostToolUse

Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.

Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications.

### Stop

Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding.

### SubagentStop

Runs when a Claude Code subagent (Task tool call) has finished responding.

## Hook Input

Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
event-specific data:

```typescript
{
  // Common fields
  session_id: string
  transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON

  // Event-specific fields
  ...
}
```

### PreToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  }
}
```

### PostToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  },
  "tool_response": {
    "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Notification Input

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "message": "Task completed successfully",
  "title": "Claude Code"
}
```

### Stop and SubagentStop Input

`stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
from running indefinitely.

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "stop_hook_active": true
}
```

## Hook Output

There are two ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
and the user.

### Simple: Exit Code

Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

- **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in transcript mode
  (CTRL-R).
- **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. `stderr` is fed back to Claude to process
  automatically. See per-hook-event behavior below.
- **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user and
  execution continues.

<Warning>
  Reminder: Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0.
</Warning>

#### Exit Code 2 Behavior

| Hook Event     | Behavior                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `PreToolUse`   | Blocks the tool call, shows error to Claude     |
| `PostToolUse`  | Shows error to Claude (tool already ran)        |
| `Notification` | N/A, shows stderr to user only                  |
| `Stop`         | Blocks stoppage, shows error to Claude          |
| `SubagentStop` | Blocks stoppage, shows error to Claude subagent |

### Advanced: JSON Output

Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control:

#### Common JSON Fields

All hook types can include these optional fields:

```json
{
  "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
  "stopReason": "string" // Message shown when continue is false
  "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
}
```

If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

- For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which only
  blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
- For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
  provides automated feedback to Claude.
- For `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, this takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.
- In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.

`stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
to Claude.

#### `PreToolUse` Decision Control

`PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

- "approve" bypasses the permission system. `reason` is shown to the user but
  not to Claude.
- "block" prevents the tool call from executing. `reason` is shown to Claude.
- `undefined` leads to the existing permission flow. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "approve" | "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `PostToolUse` Decision Control

`PostToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

- "block" automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
- `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision"
}
```

#### `Stop`/`SubagentStop` Decision Control

`Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

- "block" prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
  to know how to proceed.
- `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

```json
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

#### JSON Output Example: Bash Command Editing

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import re
import sys

# Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples
VALIDATION_RULES = [
    (
        r"\bgrep\b(?!.*\|)",
        "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
    ),
    (
        r"\bfind\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
        "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
    ),
]


def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
    issues = []
    for pattern, message in VALIDATION_RULES:
        if re.search(pattern, command):
            issues.append(message)
    return issues


try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
command = tool_input.get("command", "")

if tool_name != "Bash" or not command:
    sys.exit(1)

# Validate the command
issues = validate_command(command)

if issues:
    for message in issues:
        print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
    sys.exit(2)
```

## Working with MCP Tools

Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

### MCP Tool Naming

MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

- `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server's create entities tool
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server's read file tool
- `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server's search tool

### Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Code Formatting

Automatically format code after file modifications:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/format-code.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Notification

Customize the notification that is sent when Claude Code requests permission or
when the prompt input has become idle.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/my_custom_notifier.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

- You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
- Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
- Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
- Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
  resulting from hook usage
- You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
configuration.

### Security Best Practices

Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts
5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

### Configuration Safety

Direct edits to hooks in settings files don't take effect immediately. Claude
Code:

1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

## Hook Execution Details

- **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
  - If any individual command times out, all in-progress hooks are cancelled.
- **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
- **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
- **Input**: JSON via stdin
- **Output**:
  - PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop: Progress shown in transcript (Ctrl-R)
  - Notification: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)

## Debugging

To troubleshoot hooks:

1. Check if `/hooks` menu displays your configuration
2. Verify that your [settings files](/en/docs/claude-code/settings) are valid
   JSON
3. Test commands manually
4. Check exit codes
5. Review stdout and stderr format expectations
6. Ensure proper quote escaping
7. Use `claude --debug` to debug your hooks. The output of a successful hook
   appears like below.

```
[DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
[DEBUG] Getting matching hook commands for PostToolUse with query: Write
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook matchers in settings
[DEBUG] Matched 1 hooks for query "Write"
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
[DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 60000ms
[DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
```

Progress messages appear in transcript mode (Ctrl-R) showing:

- Which hook is running
- Command being executed
- Success/failure status
- Output or error messages

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> Learn how to set up MCP with Claude Code.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. For more details about MCP, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

<Warning>
  Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP
  servers, and be especially careful when using MCP servers that talk to the
  internet, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
</Warning>

## Configure MCP servers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP stdio Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

    # Example: Adding a local server
    claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP SSE Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding an SSE server
    claude mcp add --transport sse sse-server https://example.com/sse-endpoint

    # Example: Adding an SSE server with custom headers
    claude mcp add --transport sse api-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "X-API-Key: your-key"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP HTTP Server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

    # Example: Adding a streamable HTTP server
    claude mcp add --transport http http-server https://example.com/mcp

    # Example: Adding an HTTP server with authentication header
    claude mcp add --transport http secure-server https://api.example.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your MCP servers">
    ```bash
    # List all configured servers
    claude mcp list

    # Get details for a specific server
    claude mcp get my-server

    # Remove a server
    claude mcp remove my-server
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Use the `-s` or `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
  - `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
  - `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
  - `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `-e` or `--env` flags (e.g., `-e KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Check MCP server status any time using the `/mcp` command within Claude Code
- MCP follows a client-server architecture where Claude Code (the client) can connect to multiple specialized servers
- Claude Code supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) and streamable HTTP servers for real-time communication
- Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
  </Tip>

## Understanding MCP server scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in your project-specific user settings. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn't be shared.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server -s local /path/to/server
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server -s project /path/to/server
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server -s user /path/to/server
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

- **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
- **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently-used services

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many remote MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for secure connection to these servers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a remote server requiring authentication">
    ```bash
    # Add an SSE or HTTP server that requires OAuth
    claude mcp add --transport sse github-server https://api.github.com/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate using the /mcp command">
    Within Claude Code, use the `/mcp` command to manage authentication:

    ```
    > /mcp
    ```

    This opens an interactive menu where you can:

    * View connection status for all servers
    * Authenticate with servers requiring OAuth
    * Clear existing authentication
    * View server capabilities

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the OAuth flow">
    When you select "Authenticate" for a server:

    1. Your browser opens automatically to the OAuth provider
    2. Complete the authentication in your browser
    3. Claude Code receives and securely stores the access token
    4. The server connection becomes active

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
- Use "Clear authentication" in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
- If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the provided URL
- OAuth authentication works with both SSE and HTTP transports
  </Tip>

## Connect to a Postgres MCP server

Suppose you want to give Claude read-only access to a PostgreSQL database for querying and schema inspection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Postgres MCP server">
    ```bash
    claude mcp add postgres-server /path/to/postgres-mcp-server --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Query your database with Claude">
    ```
    > describe the schema of our users table
    ```

    ```
    > what are the most recent orders in the system?
    ```

    ```
    > show me the relationship between customers and invoices
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The Postgres MCP server provides read-only access for safety
- Claude can help you explore database structure and run analytical queries
- You can use this to quickly understand database schemas in unfamiliar projects
- Make sure your connection string uses appropriate credentials with minimum required permissions
  </Tip>

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

Suppose you have a JSON configuration for a single MCP server that you want to add to Claude Code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP server from JSON">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

    # Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
    claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the server was added">
    ```bash
    claude mcp get weather-api
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
- The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
- You can use `-s global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one
  </Tip>

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

Suppose you have already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop and want to use the same servers in Claude Code without manually reconfiguring them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import servers from Claude Desktop">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select which servers to import">
    After running the command, you'll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the servers were imported">
    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
- Use the `-s global` flag to add servers to your global configuration
- Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
- If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (e.g., `server_1`)
  </Tip>

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

Suppose you want to use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to, providing them with Claude's tools and capabilities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Claude as an MCP server">
    ```bash
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp serve
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect from another application">
    You can connect to Claude Code MCP server from any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop. If you're using Claude Desktop, you can add the Claude Code MCP server using this configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- The server provides access to Claude's tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
- In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
- Note that this MCP server is simply exposing Claude Code's tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
  </Tip>

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="List available resources">
    Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a specific resource">
    Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

    ```
    > Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
    ```

    ```
    > Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Multiple resource references">
    You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

    ```
    > Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
- Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
- Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
- Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
  </Tip>

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover available prompts">
    Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt without arguments">
    ```
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt with arguments">
    Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

    ```
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    ```

    ```
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

- MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
- Arguments are parsed based on the prompt's defined parameters
- Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
- Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)

# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  | Use Case Examples                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows         |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts             |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences    | _(Deprecated, see below)_ Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory _/_ and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in _foo/bar/_, and have memories in both _foo/CLAUDE.md_ and _foo/bar/CLAUDE.md_.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands.

Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:

```
> /init
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

- Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
- Document code style preferences and naming conventions
- Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
- CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.
  </Tip>

## Memory best practices

- **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
- **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
- **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

# Monitoring

> Learn how to enable and configure OpenTelemetry for Claude Code.

Claude Code supports OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics and events for monitoring and observability.

All metrics are time series data exported via OpenTelemetry's standard metrics protocol, and events are exported via OpenTelemetry's logs/events protocol. It is the user's responsibility to ensure their metrics and logs backends are properly configured and that the aggregation granularity meets their monitoring requirements.

<Note>
  OpenTelemetry support is currently in beta and details are subject to change.
</Note>

## Quick Start

Configure OpenTelemetry using environment variables:

```bash
# 1. Enable telemetry
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# 2. Choose exporters (both are optional - configure only what you need)
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp       # Options: otlp, prometheus, console
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp          # Options: otlp, console

# 3. Configure OTLP endpoint (for OTLP exporter)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# 4. Set authentication (if required)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# 5. For debugging: reduce export intervals
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=10000  # 10 seconds (default: 60000ms)
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT_INTERVAL=5000     # 5 seconds (default: 5000ms)

# 6. Run Claude Code
claude
```

<Note>
  The default export intervals are 60 seconds for metrics and 5 seconds for logs. During setup, you may want to use shorter intervals for debugging purposes. Remember to reset these for production use.
</Note>

For full configuration options, see the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#configuration-options).

## Administrator Configuration

Administrators can configure OpenTelemetry settings for all users through the managed settings file. This allows for centralized control of telemetry settings across an organization. See the [settings precedence](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#settings-precedence) for more information about how settings are applied.

The managed settings file is located at:

- macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
- Linux: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`

Example managed settings configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER": "otlp",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "grpc",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://collector.company.com:4317",
    "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS": "Authorization=Bearer company-token"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Managed settings can be distributed via MDM (Mobile Device Management) or other device management solutions. Environment variables defined in the managed settings file have high precedence and cannot be overridden by users.
</Note>

## Configuration Details

### Common Configuration Variables

| Environment Variable                            | Description                                               | Example Values                       |

### Metrics Cardinality Control

The following environment variables control which attributes are included in metrics to manage cardinality:

| Environment Variable                | Description                                    | Default Value | Example to Disable |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID`   | Include session.id attribute in metrics        | `true`        | `false`            |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_VERSION`      | Include app.version attribute in metrics       | `false`       | `true`             |
| `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_ACCOUNT_UUID` | Include user.account_uuid attribute in metrics | `true`        | `false`            |

These variables help control the cardinality of metrics, which affects storage requirements and query performance in your metrics backend. Lower cardinality generally means better performance and lower storage costs but less granular data for analysis.

### Multi-Team Organization Support

Organizations with multiple teams or departments can add custom attributes to distinguish between different groups using the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable:

```bash
# Add custom attributes for team identification
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="department=engineering,team.id=platform,cost_center=eng-123"
```

These custom attributes will be included in all metrics and events, allowing you to:

- Filter metrics by team or department
- Track costs per cost center
- Create team-specific dashboards
- Set up alerts for specific teams

### Example Configurations

```bash
# Console debugging (1-second intervals)
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=console
export OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL=1000

# OTLP/gRPC
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# Events/logs only (no metrics)
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```

## Interpreting Metrics and Events Data

The metrics exported by Claude Code provide valuable insights into usage patterns and productivity. Here are some common visualizations and analyses you can create:

### Usage Monitoring

| Metric                                                        | Analysis Opportunity                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude_code.token.usage`                                     | Break down by `type` (input/output), user, team, or model |

| `claude_code.lines_of_code.count`                             | Measure productivity by tracking code additions/removals  |
| `claude_code.commit.count` & `claude_code.pull_request.count` | Understand impact on development workflows                |

### Cost Monitoring

The `claude_code.cost.usage` metric helps with:

- Tracking usage trends across teams or individuals
- Identifying high-usage sessions for optimization

<Note>
  Cost metrics are approximations. For official billing data, refer to your API provider (Anthropic Console, AWS Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex).
</Note>

### Alerting and Segmentation

Common alerts to consider:

- Cost spikes
- Unusual token consumption
- High session volume from specific users

All metrics can be segmented by `user.account_uuid`, `organization.id`, `session.id`, `model`, and `app.version`.

### Event Analysis

The event data provides detailed insights into Claude Code interactions:

**Tool Usage Patterns**: Analyze tool result events to identify:

- Most frequently used tools
- Tool success rates
- Average tool execution times
- Error patterns by tool type

**Performance Monitoring**: Track API request durations and tool execution times to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Backend Considerations

Your choice of metrics and logs backends will determine the types of analyses you can perform:

### For Metrics:

- **Time series databases (e.g., Prometheus)**: Rate calculations, aggregated metrics
- **Columnar stores (e.g., ClickHouse)**: Complex queries, unique user analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (e.g., Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Advanced querying, visualization, alerting

### For Events/Logs:

- **Log aggregation systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki)**: Full-text search, log analysis
- **Columnar stores (e.g., ClickHouse)**: Structured event analysis
- **Full-featured observability platforms (e.g., Honeycomb, Datadog)**: Correlation between metrics and events

For organizations requiring Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active User (DAU/WAU/MAU) metrics, consider backends that support efficient unique value queries.

## Service Information

All metrics are exported with:

- Service Name: `claude-code`
- Service Version: Current Claude Code version
- Meter Name: `com.anthropic.claude_code`

## Security/Privacy Considerations

- Telemetry is opt-in and requires explicit configuration
- Sensitive information like API keys or file contents are never included in metrics or events
- User prompt content is redacted by default - only prompt length is recorded. To enable user prompt logging, set `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`

## Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting WSL installation

Currently, Claude Code does not run directly in Windows, and instead requires WSL.

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

- Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
- Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Optimize your terminal setup

Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

**Supported shells**:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish

### Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That's handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code's theme to your terminal during onboarding or any time via the `/config` command

### Line breaks

You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code:

- **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper configuration

To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

**Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users**: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

### Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

#### Terminal bell notifications

Enable sound alerts when tasks complete:

```sh
claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell
```

**For macOS users**: Don't forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings → Notifications → \[Your Terminal App].

#### iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell" and Filter Alerts → "Send escape sequence-generated alerts"
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

#### Custom notification hooks

For advanced notification handling, you can create [notification hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#notification) to run your own logic.

### Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

- **Avoid direct pasting**: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
- **Use file-based workflows**: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
- **Be aware of VS Code limitations**: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

### Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:

- Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
- Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`
- Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)

# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- [Installed Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/setup)
- A terminal or command prompt open
- A code project to work with

## Step 1: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You'll see the Claude Code prompt inside a new interactive session:

```
✻ Welcome to Claude Code!

...

> Try "create a util logging.py that..."
```

## Step 2: Ask your first question

Let's start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
> what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
> what technologies does this project use?
```

```
> where is the main entry point?
```

```
> explain the folder structure
```

<Note>
  Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context.
</Note>

## Step 3: Make your first code change

Now let's make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
> add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

<Note>
  Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.
</Note>

## Step 4: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
> what files have I changed?
```

```
> commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
> create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
> show me the last 5 commits
```

```
> help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 5: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
> add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
> there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

## Step 6: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:

**Refactor code**

```
> refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
> write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
> update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
> review my changes and suggest improvements
```

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
</Tip>

# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

- **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
- **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  - `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
- For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise
  managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project
  settings. System administrators can deploy policies to
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS and
  `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux and Windows via WSL.

```JSON Example settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

### Settings precedence

Settings are applied in order of precedence:

1. Enterprise policies (see [IAM documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#enterprise-managed-policy-settings))
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

## Configuration options

We are in the process of migrating global configuration to `settings.json`.

`claude config` will be deprecated in place of [settings.json](#settings-files)

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

- List settings: `claude config list`
- See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
- Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
- Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
- Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default `config` changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

### 3. Architecture & Design Patterns

**Design Patterns Applied:**
- **Command Pattern:** Implemented in `cmd/` directory for CLI command structure, enabling extensible command handling with consistent interface patterns (cobra.Command implementations)
- **Factory Pattern:** Used in `internal/providers/` for AWS service client creation, allowing dynamic instantiation of different AWS service clients based on configuration
- **Strategy Pattern:** Applied in `internal/analyzers/` for different cost analysis algorithms (EC2, RDS, Lambda analyzers), enabling pluggable analysis strategies
- **Repository Pattern:** Implemented in `internal/storage/` for data persistence abstraction, supporting multiple storage backends (local file, S3, database)
- **Observer Pattern:** Used in `internal/reporting/` for notification systems, enabling multiple output formats and delivery mechanisms

**Software Architecture Style:**
Clean Architecture with Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) principles, organized in concentric layers with clear dependency inversion. The architecture separates business logic from external dependencies, enabling testability and maintainability. Core business rules reside in the center, with adapters for AWS APIs, storage systems, and CLI interfaces at the boundaries.

**Architectural Rationale:**
The Clean Architecture approach with Hexagonal principles ensures high testability by isolating business logic from external dependencies. The Command Pattern enables extensible CLI functionality, while the Strategy Pattern allows for pluggable analysis algorithms as AWS services evolve. The Repository Pattern abstracts storage concerns, enabling flexible deployment scenarios from local development to enterprise cloud environments. This architecture supports the tool's requirement for enterprise-scale reliability while maintaining development velocity and code maintainability.

### 7. AI Assistant Guidance

**AI Common Pitfalls:**
- **AWS Cost Calculation Errors:** AI assistants frequently miscalculate AWS pricing by using outdated rates or ignoring regional variations. Always verify cost calculations against current AWS pricing API and account for Reserved Instance discounts, Spot pricing, and volume discounts. For example, assuming standard On-Demand pricing when Reserved Instances are active can lead to 40-60% cost estimation errors.
- **Oversimplified Rightsizing Recommendations:** AI often suggests instance downsizing based solely on CPU utilization without considering memory, network, or I/O requirements. Always analyze all performance metrics and consider workload patterns before recommending instance changes. A web server with 20% CPU but 90% memory utilization should not be downsized.
- **Ignoring AWS Service Interdependencies:** AI assistants may recommend optimizations that break service dependencies, such as reducing RDS instance size without considering connection pool limits or suggesting EBS volume changes that affect IOPS requirements. Always validate recommendations against the complete infrastructure stack.
- **Misunderstanding Enterprise Constraints:** AI often ignores compliance requirements, maintenance windows, and business continuity needs when suggesting optimizations. Enterprise environments require gradual rollouts, rollback plans, and approval processes that AI assistants frequently overlook.

**Behavioral Guidance:**
- **Cost Analysis Approach:** Always start with comprehensive data gathering before making recommendations. Use the tool's multi-account analysis capabilities to understand the complete cost landscape before suggesting optimizations. Present cost savings as ranges with confidence intervals rather than exact figures.
- **Safety-First Recommendations:** Prioritize low-risk optimizations first (unused resources, obvious oversizing) before suggesting complex changes. Always include rollback procedures and impact assessments with every recommendation. For critical systems, recommend testing in staging environments first.
- **Business Context Integration:** Consider business hours, seasonal patterns, and growth projections when analyzing utilization data. A development environment with low weekend utilization is different from a production system with the same pattern. Always ask about business context before making optimization recommendations.
- **Incremental Implementation:** Recommend phased implementation approaches rather than wholesale changes. Start with non-critical resources, monitor results, and gradually expand optimization scope. This approach reduces risk and builds confidence in the optimization process.

**Domain-Specific Patterns:**
- **AWS Cost Optimization Workflow:** Follow the pattern of Discover → Analyze → Recommend → Validate → Implement → Monitor. Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria. Never skip the validation phase, especially for production systems.
- **Multi-Account Analysis Pattern:** When analyzing enterprise environments, always aggregate data at the organization level before drilling down to individual accounts. Use consolidated billing data to identify cross-account optimization opportunities like Reserved Instance sharing.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management:** Understand that AWS resources have different optimization strategies based on their lifecycle stage. Development resources can be aggressively optimized for cost, while production resources require balanced cost-performance optimization.
- **Compliance and Governance Integration:** Always consider governance policies when recommending changes. Many enterprises have specific instance types, regions, or configuration requirements that must be respected regardless of cost implications.

**Technical Constraints Reference:**
For detailed technical constraints including security requirements, performance benchmarks, integration specifications, and deployment constraints, refer to Section 4 (Implementation Requirements). Key constraints include:
- AWS IAM role-based authentication with least-privilege access
- SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance requirements
- 30-second response time limits for CLI operations
- 512MB maximum memory consumption during analysis
- Support for enterprise environments with 1000+ AWS accounts

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Operational Protocol & Consistency Mandate

For you, 🤖 AI agent - Your primary function is to execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to the protocols outlined below. This is not a guide; it is your operational mandate. Each section must be processed in sequence, using the defined structure and validation checks.

### Execution Structure

Every section in this document adheres to the following mandatory structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: This block contains your direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute them precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: This block defines the required output. You MUST generate all specified artifacts to mark the section as complete. Your output must be validated against these outcomes.
- **📋 Template Variables**: This block lists variables (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`) that require substitution. You MUST replace them with the correct values from the established context.

### Critical Document Consistency Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interdependent Sections Consistency Requirements**
>
> This document contains interdependent sections that must maintain consistency to ensure coherent context engineering. Each section builds upon previous sections and informs subsequent ones. You are required to follow these consistency protocols without deviation.

#### Mandatory Cross-Section Dependencies

**(Corrected Section Numbers)**

**Primary Dependencies (Critical):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 5 (Software Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 8 (Third Party Integrations)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)
- Section 7 (Tech Stack) → Section 12 (Reference & Documentation)

**Secondary Dependencies (Important):**
- Section 5 (Software Architecture) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 9 (Local Development Setup)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 10 (Deployment)
- Section 8 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 11 (AI Assistant Guidance)

**Coherence Dependencies (Application-Type Specific):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture)
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 6 (User & Developer Experience)
- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 10 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture)

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

### 1. Initial Codebase Awareness

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔧 VALIDATE TOOL → Verify `repomix` is installed and executable.
> 2. 🔍 DISCOVER → Run `repomix --help` to understand tool capabilities.
> 3. 📊 ANALYZE → Execute `repomix` to get the complete codebase structure.
> 4. 🌳 EXTRACT & CATALOG → Generate ASCII tree and create a table of ALL initial files.
> 5. 📖 READ & SUMMARIZE → Read the generated repomix file entirely and create comprehensive overview.
> 6. 📝 CREATE OVERVIEW DOC → Generate 00-codebase-awareness-overview.md with complete repo summary.
> 7. ✅ VALIDATE & PRESENT → Ensure both artifacts are complete and ready for downstream use.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Tool Validation:** Execute `command -v repomix` or `which repomix`. If the tool is not found, report an error and halt. This step is mandatory.
>     - **Fallback Check**: If `repomix` is not in PATH, check common installation locations: `~/.local/bin/repomix`, `./node_modules/.bin/repomix`
>     - **Installation Verification**: Run `repomix --version` to confirm the tool is executable
> - **Tool Discovery:** Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and output formats.
> - **Comprehensive Codebase Analysis:** Execute `repomix` with appropriate flags based on the repository context:
>     - **For New/Small Repositories**: `repomix --style markdown --no-git-sort-by-changes -o repomix-analysis.md`
>         - This provides clean markdown output with standard file ordering
>     - **For Large/Existing Repositories**: `repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories -o repomix-structure.md`
>         - This generates structure-only output (no file contents) for faster analysis
>     - **For Template Repositories**: `repomix --style markdown --remove-empty-lines --compress -o repomix-compressed.md`
>         - This provides clean, compressed output focusing on configuration patterns
>     - **Custom Filtering**: Use `--ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules"` to exclude noise files if needed
>     - **Config Override Note**: If repository has `repomix.config.json`, use `-o filename.md` to override config settings
> - **Output Processing & Extraction:**
>     - **Directory Tree Extraction**: From repomix output, locate the "Directory Structure" section and extract the ASCII tree
>     - **File Inventory Creation**: Parse the file list from repomix output, noting file types and sizes
>     - **Metadata Analysis**: Extract repository metadata (total files, total size, ignored patterns) from repomix summary
> - **Initial State Cataloging:**
>     - Create a complete table listing **all** discovered files with classifications:
>         - `dotfile` (.gitignore, .env.example, .github/*, etc.)
>         - `configuration` (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
>         - `task-runner` (Makefile, Justfile, package.json scripts, etc.)
>         - `documentation` (README.md, docs/*, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
>         - `template` (.template files, example configs, scaffolding, etc.)
>     - **Purpose Inference**: For each file, infer purpose based on standard conventions and file patterns
> - **Error Handling & Validation:**
>     - **Verify Complete Output**: Ensure repomix completed successfully (no truncated output or error messages)
>     - **Validate Structure**: Confirm the directory tree matches expected patterns for the project type
>     - **Handle Large Repositories**: If output is too large, re-run with `--compress` or `--no-files` flags
> - **Synthesize Analysis:** Write a brief narrative summary interpreting the structured findings:
>     - State inferred project status (e.g., "newly initialized," "template-based," "active development")
>     - Highlight existing tooling and configuration patterns
>     - Note any unusual or non-standard repository structure
> - **Complete Repomix File Reading:** Read the entire generated repomix file (repomix-analysis.md) from start to finish:
>     - **Header Analysis**: Extract repository metadata, file counts, token counts, and security findings
>     - **Directory Structure Analysis**: Parse the complete directory tree structure

> 5. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure absolute coherence with Application Type and Problem Statement.
> 6. 📤 PRESENT → Output the features in the structured format below.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Your primary inputs are the `Problem & Value Proposition` (Sec 2.3) and the user-provided feature list.
> - **Epic Definition:** Analyze the user's requirements and group them into logical, high-level categories that are applicable to any application type (e.g., `Core Functionality`, `User Management`, `Data Processing`, `Integration`). These are your "Epics."
> - **User Story Formulation:** For each Epic, define its capabilities as concrete, testable user stories.
>     - **Format:** "As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`."
>     - **Persona:** Must be a specific, relevant user role (e.g., `DevOps Engineer`, `End User`, `System Administrator`).
>     - **Action:** Must describe a single, verifiable capability. The action should be granular enough to be the basis for a set of implementation tasks, but not the tasks themselves.
>     - **Benefit:** Must align directly with the `Value Proposition` from Section 2.3.
> - **Prioritization:** Assign each Epic and its constituent User Stories to one of three tiers:
>     - **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Essential for the core, functional version.
>     - **Next Phase:** Important enhancements for after the MVP is stable.
>     - **Nice to Have:** Desirable features that improve the experience but are not critical.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - All Epics and User Stories MUST be coherent with the `Application Type` (e.g., no "Interactive Dashboard" stories for a CLI tool).
> - Every User Story's `[Benefit]` MUST directly support the `Value Proposition` (Sec 2.3).
> - The set of MVP stories, when combined, MUST fully address the `Problem Statement` (Sec 2.3).
> - This section defines the **scope** of work. It MUST NOT contain the implementation details (tasks) or granular test criteria (UAC), which are generated from this section.

### 11. AI Assistant Guidance

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔄 SYNTHESIZE → Ingest context from Tech Stack (7), SW Architecture (5), and UX/DX (6).
> 2. 🧠 DERIVE PITFALLS → Based on the stack and patterns, generate the AI Common Pitfalls table.
> 3. 🎯 DEFINE GUIDANCE → Formulate explicit behavioral rules and domain patterns.
> 4. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure guidance is actionable and directly relevant to the project context.
> 5. 📤 PRESENT → Output the complete guidance protocol.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Your primary inputs are the `Tech Stack` (Sec 7), `Software Architecture` (Sec 5), and `UX/DX` (Sec 6).
> - **Derive AI Pitfalls:** You will not list generic pitfalls. You will **derive specific pitfalls** directly from the project's context.
>     - For each core technology in the `Tech Stack`, identify 1-2 common, high-risk errors (e.g., for `React`: "Incorrectly managing state, leading to unnecessary re-renders"; for `Go`: "Ignoring error returns, leading to nil pointer panics").
>     - For each architectural pattern in `Software Architecture`, identify a potential misapplication.
> - **Define Behavioral Guidance:** Formulate a list of 3-5 non-negotiable rules for any agent working on this codebase (e.g., "Always generate unit tests for new business logic," "Ask for clarification before modifying a core module").
> - **Define Domain-Specific Patterns:** Codify the project's conventions. This includes preferred coding styles, naming conventions, and specific implementation patterns that should be followed (e.g., "All new API endpoints MUST use the defined `api.Controller` struct.").
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - Every pitfall listed in the table MUST be directly relevant to a technology or pattern used in this project.
> - Behavioral guidance rules MUST be clear, unambiguous, and actionable.
> - Domain-specific patterns MUST be concrete and provide examples where necessary.

#### Output Format

**1. AI Common Pitfalls:**
*(This table provides guardrails for future AI agents to prevent common, context-specific errors.)*

| Pitfall | What It Is | How to Identify | How to Solve/Overcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (e.g., Forgetting `defer` in Go) | In Go, failing to use `defer` for cleanup actions like closing files can lead to resource leaks. | Look for functions that open resources (`os.Open`, `db.Conn`) but lack a corresponding `defer resource.Close()` call immediately after. | **Mandatory Protocol:** Immediately after successfully opening a resource that requires closing, the very next line MUST be the `defer` statement to close it. |
| (e.g., Prop Drilling in React) | Passing props down through multiple layers of components instead of using a state management solution or Context API. | A component receives and passes on props without using them itself. The same prop appears at many levels of the component tree. | **Mandatory Protocol:** For state shared by more than 2-3 levels of components, use the established state management library (`Zustand`/`Redux`) or React's Context API. Do not pass props through intermediate components. |

**2. Behavioral Guidance (Mandatory Protocols):**
- **Principle of Least Astonishment:** Generated code should follow the existing patterns in the codebase. Do not introduce new design patterns without explicit instruction.
- **Confirmation Before Destructive Actions:** You MUST ask for explicit user confirmation before generating code that performs destructive actions (e.g., `DELETE` from a database, `rm -rf`).
- **Test Generation Requirement:** All new public functions or methods containing business logic MUST be accompanied by a corresponding unit test.

**3. Domain-Specific Patterns & Conventions:**
- **Naming Conventions:** All Go interfaces will be named with an `-er` suffix (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).
- **API Error Responses:** All API error responses MUST conform to the `APIError` struct defined in `/pkg/errors/errors.go`.
- **State Management:** Global UI state is managed via the `Zustand` store defined in `src/state/store.js`. Do not use component-local state for data that needs to be shared globally.

## 📋 Project Overview

### Project Identity

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Start with these fundamental questions to establish project identity:
> - "What is the official name of your project?"
> - "What type of project are you building?" (Show options: CLI Tool, Web App, Library, etc.)
> - "In 1-2 sentences, what does your project do and what problem does it solve?"
> - "Who is your target audience?" (Developers, end users, enterprises, etc.)

- **Name**: {Project Name}
- **Type**: {CLI Tool | Web Application | Library | Framework | API Service | Mobile App | Desktop Application | Other}
- **Purpose**: {1-2 sentence description of what this project does and why it exists}
- **Target Audience**: {Who will use this project - developers, end users, enterprises, etc.}

> [!TIP]
> **For AI Agents**: Use the project type to automatically determine which configuration patterns to apply (e.g., CLI tools need different .gitignore patterns than web applications).

### Primary Language & Runtime

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Essential technical foundation questions:
> - "What is your primary programming language?"
> - "What runtime or platform does it use?"
> - "What's the minimum version you want to support?"
> 
> **Why This Matters**: This determines tooling, dependency management, and build configurations.

- **Main Language**: {Go | JavaScript/TypeScript | Python | Rust | Java | C# | Other}
- **Runtime/Platform**: {Node.js | .NET | JVM | Native | Browser | Other}
- **Minimum Version**: {Specify minimum supported version}

> [!WARNING]
> **Version Compatibility**: Be specific about minimum versions to avoid compatibility issues. This affects CI/CD setup and documentation.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Ask about the main architectural components:
> - "What framework or library forms the backbone of your project?"
> - "Do you use a database? Which one?"
> - "How do you handle authentication?" (if applicable)
> - "What testing framework do you use?"
> 
> **Context**: These choices drive configuration file patterns and development setup.

- **Primary Framework**: {Express.js | React | Django | Gin | FastAPI | Spring Boot | Other | None}
- **Database**: {PostgreSQL | MySQL | MongoDB | SQLite | Redis | None | Other}
- **Authentication**: {JWT | OAuth2 | Session-based | None | Other}
- **Testing Framework**: {Jest | pytest | go test | JUnit | Other | None}

> [!TIP]
> **Framework-Specific Configs**: Each framework has specific configuration needs (e.g., React projects need .env handling, Django needs specific .gitignore patterns).

### Development Tools

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Development workflow questions:
> - "What build system do you use?" (npm, go modules, pip, etc.)
> - "Do you use a linter? Which one?"
> - "Do you use code formatting? Which tool?"
> - "What CI/CD platform do you use?"
> 
> **Purpose**: Determines .editorconfig, pre-commit hooks, and workflow configurations.

- **Build System**: {npm/yarn | go modules | pip | cargo | gradle | maven | other}
- **Linting**: {ESLint | golangci-lint | flake8 | clippy | other | none}
- **Formatting**: {Prettier | gofmt | black | rustfmt | other | none}
- **CI/CD**: {GitHub Actions | GitLab CI | Jenkins | other | none}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Consistency Impact**: These tools directly affect .editorconfig, .gitignore, and CI/CD workflow configurations.

### External Dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Focus on major dependencies:
> - "What are the 3-5 most important external libraries or services your project depends on?"
> - "What role does each dependency play in your project?"
> 
> **Note**: Don't list every dependency—focus on key ones that define capabilities or affect configuration.

List key external libraries, frameworks, or services:
- {Dependency 1}: {Purpose/Role in project}
- {Dependency 2}: {Purpose/Role in project}
- {Dependency 3}: {Purpose/Role in project}

> [!TIP]
> **Configuration Impact**: Major dependencies often require specific .gitignore patterns, environment variables, or documentation sections.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

### Project Type Classification

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Multiple selection question:
> - "Which of these best describe your project architecture?" (Allow multiple selections)
> - Use this to determine repository structure and configuration needs.

- [ ] **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- [ ] **Web API/Service**
- [ ] **Frontend Application**
- [ ] **Full-Stack Application**
- [ ] **Library/Package**
- [ ] **Microservice**
- [ ] **Monorepo**
- [ ] **Docker-based Application**
- [ ] **Serverless Function**

> [!WARNING]
> **Configuration Dependencies**: Each architecture type requires different .gitignore patterns, CI/CD setups, and documentation structures.

### Project Structure Diagram

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: Ask users to describe their repository structure:
> - "What are your main directories and what do they contain?"
> - "Do you follow any specific organizational patterns?"
> 
> **For AI Agents**: Use this to generate accurate .gitignore patterns and documentation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[{project-root}/] --> B[{src/|lib/|app/}]
    A --> C[{tests/|__tests__/|test/}]
    A --> D[{docs/|documentation/}]
    A --> E[{config/|configs/}]
    A --> F[{scripts/|bin/}]

    F --> F1[{Build/deployment scripts}]
    G --> G1[{Specify purpose}]
```

> [!TIP]
> **Customization**: Replace the generic directory names with your actual directory structure and describe their specific purposes.

### Data Flow Architecture

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: For applications with data flow:
> - "How does data move through your system?"
> - "What are the main data sources and destinations?"
> - "Are there any external APIs or services involved?"
> 
> **Skip if**: Your project is a simple library or doesn't have complex data flow.

```mermaid

    A[{Data Source 1}] --> B[{Processing Layer}]
    C[{Data Source 2}] --> B
    B --> D[{Business Logic}]
    D --> E[{Data Storage}]
    D --> F[{External API}]
    D --> G[{Output/Response}]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Replace Placeholders**: Customize this diagram with your actual data sources, processing steps, and outputs.

### User Flow Diagram

> [!NOTE]
> **Interactive Guidance**: For user-facing applications:
> - "What are the main user interactions with your application?"
> - "What is the typical user journey?"
> - "Are there different user types with different flows?"
> 
> **Skip if**: Your project is a library, CLI tool without complex workflows, or API-only service.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Entry Point] --> B{Authentication Required?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Login/Register]
    B -->|No| D[Main Application]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Core Functionality]
    E --> F[Results/Output]
    F --> G[Next Action/Exit]
```

> [!TIP]
> **User-Centric Design**: Focus on the user's perspective and main interaction patterns, not internal system details.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[CONTACT_EMAIL] or by creating a private issue in this repository.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 2.0, available at
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct
enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

description: "Enforce comprehensive content quality standards for cursor rules including MDC format compliance, YAML frontmatter structure, and technical writing precision"
globs: ["**/*.mdc", ".cursor/rules/**"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Cursor Rule Content Standards

## Description

This rule enforces comprehensive content quality standards for cursor rules that follow MDC (Model-Driven Code) format specifications. It ensures consistency, completeness, and technical precision in cursor rule content, covering YAML frontmatter structure, content organization, language precision, and quality validation. For file location and organization requirements, see [cursor-rules-location.mdc](cursor-rules-location.mdc).

## Rule

Create cursor rules with proper MDC format:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Include `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` fields with correct syntax
2. **Required Sections**: Description → Rule → Implementation → Benefits → Examples
3. **Direct Language**: Use imperative commands ("Execute", "Create", "Validate")
4. **Relative Paths**: Never use absolute paths in rule content
5. **Validate Syntax**: Check YAML and markdown formatting before saving

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Real-time YAML/markdown syntax validation
- Template generation for required sections
- Content quality checks during editing

**Technical Enforcement:**
- YAML syntax validation
- Markdown linting
- Section completeness verification

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Uniform structure across all cursor rules
2. **Quality**: Production-ready technical documentation
3. **Completeness**: All required sections present and validated
4. **Maintainability**: Clear structure with comprehensive examples

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Content Implementation

**YAML Frontmatter Example:**
```yaml
---
description: "Enforce TypeScript coding standards and best practices"
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Section Structure Example:**
```markdown
# Rule Title
## Description
## Rule
## Implementation
## Benefits
## Examples
```

### ❌ Incorrect Content Implementation

**Malformed Cursor Rule Content:**

```markdown
description: TypeScript rule
globs: *.ts
---

# TypeScript

This rule is about TypeScript...

## Some Requirements
- Maybe use types
- Could be good to check things
```

**Content Problems Identified:**
```
Content Issues/
├── Invalid YAML frontmatter syntax
├── Missing required fields (alwaysApply)
├── Incomplete content structure (missing Implementation, Benefits, Examples)
├── Vague language ("maybe", "could be")
├── No specific, actionable requirements
└── Missing technical precision and clarity
```

### 🔧 MDC Content Format Reference

**Complete YAML Frontmatter Example:**
```yaml
---
description: "Brief, actionable description of rule purpose and scope"
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.js"]  # Array format for multiple patterns
alwaysApply: true  # Boolean for global application
---
```

**Required Section Order:**
```
1. Description - Clear purpose and scope
2. Rule - Numbered, specific requirements
3. Implementation - Technical enforcement details
4. Benefits - Organizational advantages
5. Examples - Correct/incorrect patterns
```

**Content Quality Checklist:**
```
Content Validation/
├── YAML frontmatter syntax validation ✅
├── Required sections present ✅
├── Language precision maintained ✅
├── Technical terms clearly defined ✅
├── Examples include both correct/incorrect patterns ✅
├── ASCII diagrams render properly ✅
└── Cross-references to related rules ✅

description: "Enforce consistent file location, naming conventions, and organizational structure for cursor rules within .cursor/rules directory"
globs: ["**/*.mdc", ".cursor/rules/**"]
alwaysApply: true

# Cursor Rules Location Management

## Description

Enforce consistent location and organization of all cursor rules within the `.cursor/rules` directory. This rule ensures systematic file management, proper naming conventions, and centralized rule governance for optimal cursor IDE integration and team collaboration. For content quality and MDC format standards, see [cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc](cursor-rules-creation-standards.mdc).

## Rule

Execute this mandatory protocol for all cursor rule file organization and management:

1. **Directory Structure Enforcement**: Create all cursor rules exclusively in `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. **File Naming Standards**: Use kebab-case naming convention: `[rule-name].mdc`
3. **File Extension Compliance**: Apply `.mdc` extension to all cursor rule files
4. **Individual File Separation**: Maintain one rule per file for modular management
5. **Version Control Integration**: Ensure all rules are tracked and documented in repository
6. **Access Control**: Validate file permissions and accessibility
7. **Naming Descriptiveness**: Use clear, purpose-indicating rule names that reflect functionality
8. **Path Validation**: Ensure all file paths are accessible and follow project conventions

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Global application (`alwaysApply: true`) ensures continuous enforcement across all file operations
- File pattern matching targets both `.mdc` files and `.cursor/rules/` directory structure
- Real-time validation prevents rule creation outside designated directory
- Automatic suggestions for proper naming conventions and file placement

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Directory structure validation before rule creation
- File extension verification during save operations
- Naming convention compliance checking
- File system accessibility validation
- Path verification and correction suggestions

**Automated Workflow Integration:**
- IDE prompts for proper rule location during creation
- Template generation with pre-populated directory paths
- File organization suggestions based on rule purpose
- Conflict resolution for duplicate rule names
- Migration assistance for misplaced rule files

## Benefits

### Organization & Maintainability
1. **Centralized Management**: Single directory location simplifies rule discovery and maintenance
2. **Predictable Structure**: Consistent organization reduces cognitive load for team members
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Systematic approach supports growing rule repositories
4. **Version Control Clarity**: Clear file organization improves change tracking and reviews

### Team Collaboration
5. **Standardized Workflow**: Uniform rule file management process across all team members
6. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Centralized location enables quick rule identification
7. **Conflict Prevention**: Systematic naming prevents duplicate or conflicting rule files
8. **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can quickly understand rule file organization

### Technical Excellence
9. **IDE Optimization**: Proper file structure maximizes cursor IDE performance and features
10. **Integration Readiness**: Standardized file organization supports automated tooling and scripts
11. **Error Reduction**: Consistent file structure minimizes configuration and deployment errors
12. **Future-Proofing**: Systematic file organization accommodates rule system evolution

## Examples

### ✅ Correct File Organization

**Proper Directory Structure:**
```
project-root/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/                    ✅ Centralized rules directory
│       ├── api-validation.mdc    ✅ Kebab-case naming
│       ├── code-formatting.mdc   ✅ Descriptive purpose
│       ├── security-headers.mdc  ✅ Clear functionality
│       ├── typescript-rules.mdc  ✅ Technology-specific
│       └── documentation.mdc     ✅ Consistent extension
└── [other project files]
```

**File Naming Conventions:**
```
✅ CORRECT NAMING:
├── typescript-standards.mdc       # Technology + purpose
├── security-authentication.mdc   # Domain + function
├── documentation-metadata.mdc     # Type + specification
└── build-optimization.mdc        # Process + goal

✅ DESCRIPTIVE PATTERNS:
├── [technology]-[purpose].mdc     # e.g., react-hooks.mdc
├── [domain]-[function].mdc        # e.g., api-versioning.mdc
├── [process]-[goal].mdc           # e.g., test-coverage.mdc
└── [feature]-[requirement].mdc    # e.g., auth-tokens.mdc
```

### ❌ Incorrect File Organization

**Problematic Directory Structures:**
```
❌ SCATTERED PLACEMENT:
project-root/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── rules/
│   │   └── some-rule.mdc
│   └── other-config/
│       └── another-rule.mdc      # ❌ Wrong location
├── docs/
│   └── cursor-rules.mdc          # ❌ Outside .cursor/
└── rules/
    └── legacy-rule.mdc           # ❌ Wrong directory

❌ NAMING VIOLATIONS:
├── .cursor/rules/
│   ├── MyRule.mdc                # ❌ PascalCase instead of kebab-case
│   ├── api_validation.mdc        # ❌ Snake_case instead of kebab-case
│   ├── rule1.mdc                 # ❌ Non-descriptive naming
│   ├── temp.mdc                  # ❌ Temporary/unclear purpose
│   └── SECURITY.MDC              # ❌ All caps, wrong extension case
```

### 🔧 File Organization Patterns

**Migration Commands:**
```bash
# ✅ Correct migration process
mv cursor-rule.mdc .cursor/rules/api-standards.mdc
mv legacy-rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
find . -name "*.mdc" -not -path "./.cursor/rules/*" -exec mv {} .cursor/rules/ \;
```

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# ✅ Verify rule location compliance
find .cursor/rules/ -name "*.mdc" -type f | wc -l    # Count rules
ls -la .cursor/rules/                                # Verify structure
find . -name "*.mdc" -not -path "./.cursor/rules/*"  # Find misplaced rules
```

**Directory Structure Validation:**
```
✅ COMPLIANT STRUCTURE:
.cursor/
└── rules/              # Single, centralized location
    ├── *.mdc          # All rules in designated directory
    └── [subdirs]/     # Optional categorization (if needed)
        └── *.mdc      # Organized by domain/technology

❌ NON-COMPLIANT PATTERNS:
├── .cursor/custom/rules/     # Extra nesting
├── cursor-rules/             # Wrong directory name
├── .vscode/rules/            # Wrong IDE directory
└── docs/cursor/              # Mixed with documentation
```

**File Organization Checklist:**
```
File Organization Validation/
├── All .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ directory ✅
├── Kebab-case naming convention followed ✅
├── Descriptive, purpose-indicating file names ✅
├── No duplicate or conflicting rule files ✅
├── Proper file extensions (.mdc) ✅
├── Files accessible and readable ✅
└── Cross-references between related rules ✅
```

description: "Detect repository stack and update gitignore patterns accordingly"
globs: [".gitignore"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Stack-Aware Gitignore Management

## Description

Automatically update `.gitignore` patterns based on detected repository technology stack. Add stack-specific exclusions only when corresponding technology files are present.

## Rule

Execute stack detection and update `.gitignore` patterns:

1. **Detect Stack**: Scan for `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`
2. **Add Patterns**: Include technology-specific patterns only for detected technologies
3. **Preserve Security**: Always include universal security exclusions (`.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`)
4. **Avoid Bloat**: Do not add patterns for technologies not present in repository

### Stack Detection Commands

```bash
# Node.js detection
[ -f package.json ] && add_patterns="node_modules/ dist/ .npm npm-debug.log*"

# Python detection
[ -f requirements.txt ] && add_patterns="__pycache__/ *.pyc venv/ .pytest_cache/"

# Go detection
[ -f go.mod ] && add_patterns="vendor/ *.exe *.test go.work"

# Rust detection
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && add_patterns="target/ Cargo.lock"

# Docker detection
[ -f Dockerfile ] && add_patterns="docker-compose.override.yml"
```

## Implementation

**Cursor IDE Integration:**
- Triggers on technology file creation/modification
- Suggests `.gitignore` updates based on detected stack
- Prevents duplicate pattern addition

**Technical Enforcement:**
- Pattern validation before addition
- Duplicate pattern detection
- Alphabetical pattern organization

## Benefits

1. **Minimal Patterns**: Only includes patterns for technologies actually used
2. **Automatic Updates**: Detects new technologies and suggests exclusions
3. **Security First**: Always includes universal security patterns
4. **No Redundancy**: Prevents duplicate or irrelevant patterns

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Stack Detection

**Node.js Project:**
```bash
# Detected: package.json exists
# Add to .gitignore:
node_modules/
dist/
.npm
npm-debug.log*
```

**Go Project:**
```bash
# Detected: go.mod exists
# Add to .gitignore:
vendor/
*.exe
*.test
go.work
```

### ❌ Incorrect Pattern Addition

```bash
# ❌ Adding Python patterns to Node.js-only project
__pycache__/  # Technology not detected

# ❌ Adding all patterns regardless of stack
node_modules/  # In Go-only project
target/        # In Node.js-only project
```

### 3. Architecture & Design Patterns

**Design Patterns Applied:**
- **Command Pattern:** Implemented in `cmd/` directory for CLI command structure, enabling extensible command handling with consistent interface patterns (cobra.Command implementations)
- **Factory Pattern:** Used in `internal/providers/` for AWS service client creation, allowing dynamic instantiation of different AWS service clients based on configuration
- **Strategy Pattern:** Applied in `internal/analyzers/` for different cost analysis algorithms (EC2, RDS, Lambda analyzers), enabling pluggable analysis strategies
- **Repository Pattern:** Implemented in `internal/storage/` for data persistence abstraction, supporting multiple storage backends (local file, S3, database)
- **Observer Pattern:** Used in `internal/reporting/` for notification systems, enabling multiple output formats and delivery mechanisms

**Software Architecture Style:**
Clean Architecture with Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) principles, organized in concentric layers with clear dependency inversion. The architecture separates business logic from external dependencies, enabling testability and maintainability. Core business rules reside in the center, with adapters for AWS APIs, storage systems, and CLI interfaces at the boundaries.

**Architectural Rationale:**
The Clean Architecture approach with Hexagonal principles ensures high testability by isolating business logic from external dependencies. The Command Pattern enables extensible CLI functionality, while the Strategy Pattern allows for pluggable analysis algorithms as AWS services evolve. The Repository Pattern abstracts storage concerns, enabling flexible deployment scenarios from local development to enterprise cloud environments. This architecture supports the tool's requirement for enterprise-scale reliability while maintaining development velocity and code maintainability.

- **Testing Framework:** Native Go testing package with testify/assert for enhanced assertions
- **Linting:** golangci-lint v1.54+ with comprehensive linting rules and security checks
- **Code Formatting:** gofmt and goimports for consistent code formatting and import organization
- **Documentation:** godoc for API documentation generation and markdown for user documentation
- **Version Control:** Git with semantic versioning and conventional commit messages

**Deployment & Infrastructure:**
- **Containerization:** Docker with multi-stage builds for minimal production images
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and release management
- **Binary Distribution:** GitHub Releases with cross-platform binary artifacts (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Package Managers:** Homebrew for macOS, apt/yum repositories for Linux distributions
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics integration with Grafana dashboards for operational visibility
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS Lambda packaging for serverless execution, ECS/EKS for containerized deployment

**Technology Decision Rationale:**
Go was selected as the primary language for its exceptional performance in concurrent operations, native AWS SDK support, and single-binary deployment model that simplifies distribution and installation. The language's strong typing system and excellent error handling patterns align perfectly with the reliability requirements for enterprise cost optimization tools. Cobra framework provides industry-standard CLI patterns with excellent documentation and community support, while AWS SDK for Go v2 offers the most comprehensive and performant AWS integration available.

The choice of Zap for logging provides the structured output and performance characteristics required for enterprise environments, while Viper enables flexible configuration management across different deployment scenarios. The decision to use native Go concurrency primitives rather than external frameworks ensures optimal performance for parallel AWS API processing and reduces external dependencies. Docker containerization supports modern deployment practices while maintaining the simplicity of single-binary distribution for development and testing environments.

### 7. AI Assistant Guidance

**AI Common Pitfalls:**
- **AWS Cost Calculation Errors:** AI assistants frequently miscalculate AWS pricing by using outdated rates or ignoring regional variations. Always verify cost calculations against current AWS pricing API and account for Reserved Instance discounts, Spot pricing, and volume discounts. For example, assuming standard On-Demand pricing when Reserved Instances are active can lead to 40-60% cost estimation errors.
- **Oversimplified Rightsizing Recommendations:** AI often suggests instance downsizing based solely on CPU utilization without considering memory, network, or I/O requirements. Always analyze all performance metrics and consider workload patterns before recommending instance changes. A web server with 20% CPU but 90% memory utilization should not be downsized.
- **Ignoring AWS Service Interdependencies:** AI assistants may recommend optimizations that break service dependencies, such as reducing RDS instance size without considering connection pool limits or suggesting EBS volume changes that affect IOPS requirements. Always validate recommendations against the complete infrastructure stack.
- **Misunderstanding Enterprise Constraints:** AI often ignores compliance requirements, maintenance windows, and business continuity needs when suggesting optimizations. Enterprise environments require gradual rollouts, rollback plans, and approval processes that AI assistants frequently overlook.

**Behavioral Guidance:**
- **Cost Analysis Approach:** Always start with comprehensive data gathering before making recommendations. Use the tool's multi-account analysis capabilities to understand the complete cost landscape before suggesting optimizations. Present cost savings as ranges with confidence intervals rather than exact figures.
- **Safety-First Recommendations:** Prioritize low-risk optimizations first (unused resources, obvious oversizing) before suggesting complex changes. Always include rollback procedures and impact assessments with every recommendation. For critical systems, recommend testing in staging environments first.
- **Business Context Integration:** Consider business hours, seasonal patterns, and growth projections when analyzing utilization data. A development environment with low weekend utilization is different from a production system with the same pattern. Always ask about business context before making optimization recommendations.
- **Incremental Implementation:** Recommend phased implementation approaches rather than wholesale changes. Start with non-critical resources, monitor results, and gradually expand optimization scope. This approach reduces risk and builds confidence in the optimization process.

**Domain-Specific Patterns:**
- **AWS Cost Optimization Workflow:** Follow the pattern of Discover → Analyze → Recommend → Validate → Implement → Monitor. Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria. Never skip the validation phase, especially for production systems.
- **Multi-Account Analysis Pattern:** When analyzing enterprise environments, always aggregate data at the organization level before drilling down to individual accounts. Use consolidated billing data to identify cross-account optimization opportunities like Reserved Instance sharing.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management:** Understand that AWS resources have different optimization strategies based on their lifecycle stage. Development resources can be aggressively optimized for cost, while production resources require balanced cost-performance optimization.
- **Compliance and Governance Integration:** Always consider governance policies when recommending changes. Many enterprises have specific instance types, regions, or configuration requirements that must be respected regardless of cost implications.

**Technical Constraints Reference:**
For detailed technical constraints including security requirements, performance benchmarks, integration specifications, and deployment constraints, refer to Section 4 (Implementation Requirements). Key constraints include:
- AWS IAM role-based authentication with least-privilege access
- SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance requirements
- 30-second response time limits for CLI operations
- 512MB maximum memory consumption during analysis
- Support for enterprise environments with 1000+ AWS accounts

# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

- Section 6 (User & Developer Experience) → Section 7 (Tech Stack)
- Section 10 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture)

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context-type-full.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context-type-full.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context-type-full.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

>         - `task-runner` (Makefile, Justfile, package.json scripts, etc.)
>         - `documentation` (README.md, docs/*, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
>         - `template` (.template files, example configs, scaffolding, etc.)
>     - **Purpose Inference**: For each file, infer purpose based on standard conventions and file patterns
> - **Error Handling & Validation:**
>     - **Verify Complete Output**: Ensure repomix completed successfully (no truncated output or error messages)
>     - **Validate Structure**: Confirm the directory tree matches expected patterns for the project type
>     - **Handle Large Repositories**: If output is too large, re-run with `--compress` or `--no-files` flags
> - **Synthesize Analysis:** Write a brief narrative summary interpreting the structured findings:
>     - State inferred project status (e.g., "newly initialized," "template-based," "active development")

> - **Configuration Synthesis:**
>     - Use the user's input as the primary source for the configuration.
>     - For any settings *not* specified by the user, apply the default best practices defined in the schema below (e.g., `require_code_owner_reviews: true`).
>     - Auto-infer technology-specific `labels` and CI/CD `contexts` based on the tech stack that will be defined in Section 7. Use placeholders if the stack is currently unknown.
> - **YAML Generation:** Create a single, complete `settings.yml` configuration block in memory. **You MUST substitute all `{{template_variables}}` with their actual values.**
> - **File Operation:**
>     - Check if `.github/settings.yml` exists.
>     - If it exists, update it with the generated configuration.
>     - If it does not exist, create the file at `.github/settings.yml` and write the generated configuration to it.
> - **Summary Table Generation:** After creating the final YAML, generate the "Repository Summary Table" as a high-level view.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - The generated YAML MUST be syntactically correct.

### 3. Features

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔄 SYNTHESIZE → Ingest context from Sec 2.2, 2.3, and user input.
> 2. 🗂️ DEFINE EPICS → Group user requirements into high-level feature categories (Epics).
> 3. 📖 FORMULATE USER STORIES → For each Epic, define specific, testable capabilities as user stories.
> 4. 🎯 PRIORITIZE → Classify each Epic and its User Stories into tiers (MVP, etc.).
> 5. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure absolute coherence with Application Type and Problem Statement.
> 6. 📤 PRESENT → Output the features in the structured format below.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Your primary inputs are the `Problem & Value Proposition` (Sec 2.3) and the user-provided feature list.
> - **Epic Definition:** Analyze the user's requirements and group them into logical, high-level categories that are applicable to any application type (e.g., `Core Functionality`, `User Management`, `Data Processing`, `Integration`). These are your "Epics."
> - **User Story Formulation:** For each Epic, define its capabilities as concrete, testable user stories.
>     - **Format:** "As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`."
>     - **Persona:** Must be a specific, relevant user role (e.g., `DevOps Engineer`, `End User`, `System Administrator`).
>     - **Action:** Must describe a single, verifiable capability. The action should be granular enough to be the basis for a set of implementation tasks, but not the tasks themselves.
>     - **Benefit:** Must align directly with the `Value Proposition` from Section 2.3.
> - **Prioritization:** Assign each Epic and its constituent User Stories to one of three tiers:
>     - **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Essential for the core, functional version.
>     - **Next Phase:** Important enhancements for after the MVP is stable.
>     - **Nice to Have:** Desirable features that improve the experience but are not critical.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - All Epics and User Stories MUST be coherent with the `Application Type` (e.g., no "Interactive Dashboard" stories for a CLI tool).
> - Every User Story's `[Benefit]` MUST directly support the `Value Proposition` (Sec 2.3).
> - The set of MVP stories, when combined, MUST fully address the `Problem Statement` (Sec 2.3).
> - This section defines the **scope** of work. It MUST NOT contain the implementation details (tasks) or granular test criteria (UAC), which are generated from this section.

#### Output Format

**MVP Features (Core Functional Scope)**

* **Epic: `[Name of the first high-level feature category]`**
    * **Target Persona:** `[Primary user for this epic]`
    * **User Stories:**
        * As a `[Persona]`, I want to `[Action]` so that `[Benefit]`.

> ```
> 1. 🏗️ DETERMINE TYPE → Identify the Application Type from Section 3.
> 2. 🏛️ SELECT COMPONENTS → Choose the relevant architectural components based on the type.
> 3. ✍️ GENERATE CONTENT → Populate the subsections for the selected components.
> 4. 📊 GENERATE DIAGRAM → Create a high-level System Architecture Diagram using Mermaid syntax.
> 5. 📝 WRITE RATIONALE → Justify the architectural choices, tailored to the application type.
> 6. ✅ VALIDATE → Ensure 100% coherence with Section 3 and the application type.
> 7. 📤 PRESENT → Output the complete, adaptive architecture specification.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Application Type Determination:** Your first action is to read Section 3 and explicitly state the `Application Type` by choosing from the expanded list in the rules below. This determination will govern the structure of your entire output for this section.
> - **Component Selection & Generation:** Based on the `Application Type`, you will generate content for the relevant subsections only. Adhere strictly to the `Critical Coherence Rules` below. For example, if the type is `AI Agent`, you will omit `Frontend Architecture`.
> - **System Architecture Diagram:** You MUST generate a high-level system diagram using **Mermaid syntax**. The diagram MUST be representative of the chosen application type (e.g., a desktop app diagram should not show a CDN).
> - **Architectural Rationale:** You must write a justification for your architectural decisions. This rationale must be tailored to the application type, explaining how the chosen architecture effectively supports the MVP features from Section 3 and addresses common concerns for that type (e.g., for a SaaS App, address multi-tenancy; for a script, address portability).
>
> **🔗 Cross-Section Dependencies:**
> 
> This section has a critical dependency on Section 3 (Features). The architecture you define here MUST be capable of supporting all defined MVP User Stories.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - The `Application Type Assessment` MUST be the first output.
> - The generated subsections MUST be 100% coherent with the assessed `Application Type`.
> - The Mermaid diagram MUST be syntactically correct and accurately reflect the described components for the specific application type.
> - The `Architectural Rationale` MUST provide a clear and logical justification for the design choices.
> - All architectural components defined MUST directly enable the MVP features from Section 3.
>
> **🚨 Critical Coherence Rules (Mandatory & Expanded):**
>
> - **If `Web Application`:** MUST include `Frontend`, `Backend`, and `Database` sections.
> - **If `API Service`:** OMIT `Frontend`. MUST include `Backend` and `Database`.
> - **If `CLI Tool`:** OMIT `Frontend`. OMIT `Database` unless explicitly required. Rename `Backend` to `Core Logic`.
> - **If `Desktop Application`:** MUST include `Frontend (Native UI)` and `Core Logic`. `Database` should be described as `Local Storage/Persistence`.
> - **If `AI Agent / Automation`:** OMIT `Frontend` and `Database`. Rename `Backend` to `Agent Execution Engine`. Focus on data flow, state management, and tool integration.
> - **If `Library / SDK`:** OMIT all except `Core Logic`. Rename to `Library Core Architecture`. Focus on the public API and module design.

> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Context Synthesis:** Your primary inputs are the `Application Type Assessment` from Section 4 and the `MVP Features` from Section 3.
> - **Define Style, Patterns & Components:**
>     - Define the overall software architecture style (e.g., Clean Architecture, Layered).
>     - **Recommend and justify** 2-3 key software design patterns that are idiomatic for the `Application Type` and anticipated `Tech Stack`. (e.g., "For this Go CLI, the **Builder Pattern** is recommended for constructing complex API request objects.").
>     - List the main software components (e.g., `Authentication Service`, `Data Processing Module`) and their responsibilities.
> - **Generate Project Structure:** Create an ASCII tree for the recommended source code directory structure. This structure MUST be **extremely well-thought-out and idiomatic** for the specific `Application Type` and `Tech Stack`. Do not use generic examples.
> - **Generate Sequence Diagram:** You MUST create a **Mermaid sequence diagram** illustrating the primary MVP use cases from Section 3. The diagram must be detailed, naming the actual software components you defined above. The nature of the diagram must adapt to the application type (see rules below).
>
> **🔗 Cross-Section Dependencies:**
> 
> This section has critical dependencies on Section 3 (Features) and Section 4 (Architecture).

> - The `MVP Sequence Diagram` MUST feature the specific components defined in this section and accurately model the MVP use cases from Section 3.
>
> **🚨 Critical Coherence Rules for Diagrams & Structure (Mandatory):**
>
> - **For `Web/Desktop App`:** Diagram shows end-user interaction flows. Structure separates client, server, and shared logic.
> - **For `API Service`:** Diagram shows client API calls and internal service interactions. Structure follows idiomatic backend patterns (e.g., feature-based folders, domain-driven design).
> - **For `CLI Tool`:** Diagram shows command execution flow. Structure is idiomatic for the language (e.g., Go's `cmd/` and `internal/`).
> - **For `Library/SDK`:** Diagram shows primary API call sequences. Structure prioritizes a clear public API surface (`/pkg` or `/lib`).
> - **For `AI Agent/Automation`:** Diagram shows the agent's `State -> Plan -> Tool -> Observation` loop. Structure separates the agent core, tools, and state management.

#### Output Format

**Software Design & Patterns:**
*(Define the architectural style. Recommend and justify 2-3 key, idiomatic design patterns with examples of where they would apply. List the main software components and their responsibilities.

**Recommended Project Structure:**
*(Present a well-thought-out, idiomatic directory structure with justifications for key organizational choices.)*

*Example for a Go CLI Tool:*

```
{{repository_name}}/
├── cmd/{{repository_name}}/   # Main application entry point
│   └── main.go
├── internal/               # Private application and library code
│   ├── command/            # CLI command definitions and logic
│   ├── config/             # Configuration loading and management
│   └── provider/           # Interfaces to external services (e.g., AWS)
├── pkg/                    # Public library code (if any)
└── Makefile                # Build and task automation
```

*Rationale: This structure follows Go community best practices, clearly separating the executable entry point from private internal logic, ensuring maintainability and a clean project layout.*

**MVP Sequence Diagram:**
*(Create a specific Mermaid sequence diagram for the MVP use cases from Section 3.)*

*Example for an API Service:*
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

#### Output Format

**1. AI Common Pitfalls:**
*(This table provides guardrails for future AI agents to prevent common, context-specific errors.)*

| Pitfall | What It Is | How to Identify | How to Solve/Overcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (e.g., Forgetting `defer` in Go) | In Go, failing to use `defer` for cleanup actions like closing files can lead to resource leaks. | Look for functions that open resources (`os.Open`, `db.Conn`) but lack a corresponding `defer resource.Close()` call immediately after. | **Mandatory Protocol:** Immediately after successfully opening a resource that requires closing, the very next line MUST be the `defer` statement to close it. |
| (e.g., Prop Drilling in React) | Passing props down through multiple layers of components instead of using a state management solution or Context API. | A component receives and passes on props without using them itself. The same prop appears at many levels of the component tree. | **Mandatory Protocol:** For state shared by more than 2-3 levels of components, use the established state management library (`Zustand`/`Redux`) or React's Context API. Do not pass props through intermediate components. |

**2. Behavioral Guidance (Mandatory Protocols):**
- **Principle of Least Astonishment:** Generated code should follow the existing patterns in the codebase. Do not introduce new design patterns without explicit instruction.
- **Confirmation Before Destructive Actions:** You MUST ask for explicit user confirmation before generating code that performs destructive actions (e.g., `DELETE` from a database, `rm -rf`).
- **Test Generation Requirement:** All new public functions or methods containing business logic MUST be accompanied by a corresponding unit test.

**3. Domain-Specific Patterns & Conventions:**
- **Naming Conventions:** All Go interfaces will be named with an `-er` suffix (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`).
- **API Error Responses:** All API error responses MUST conform to the `APIError` struct defined in `/pkg/errors/errors.go`.
- **State Management:** Global UI state is managed via the `Zustand` store defined in `src/state/store.js`. Do not use component-local state for data that needs to be shared globally.

1. **Existing Codebase Analysis (Primary Source)**
   - Execute comprehensive repository analysis following the [Context Gathering Rules](#context-gathering-rules) protocols
   - Use [repomix codebase analysis](#context-gathering-rules) for systematic structure and pattern extraction
   - Ensure all technical decisions reference concrete file:line evidence from existing implementation
   - Link findings to established patterns, configurations, and architectural decisions

2. **User Examples and Specifications (Primary Source)**
   - Examine `docs/00_context_engineering/examples/` directory for user-created examples that demonstrate intended patterns and implementations
   - These examples represent precise user intentions and should be prioritized as authoritative implementation guidance
   - Extract common patterns, architectural decisions, and implementation approaches from provided examples
   - Cross-reference all technical decisions against example implementations

3. **Documentation and Configuration Context**
   - Prioritize `docs/`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and inline code documentation
   - Examine build configs, CI/CD pipelines, dependency manifests, and development environment setup
   - Review design documents, API specifications, and system diagrams when available
   - Analyze git history and change patterns for evolution understanding

4. **AI Agent Context Analysis (High Priority)**
   - **Agent Configuration Files**: Examine `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENT.md` for existing AI assistant configurations, workflows, and established patterns
   - **Cursor Rules Integration**: Analyze `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files to understand IDE-specific AI behaviors, coding standards, and automated workflows
   - **Agent Interaction Patterns**: Extract established human-AI collaboration protocols, prompt patterns, and context engineering approaches already in use
   - **Workflow Optimization**: Identify opportunities to align new AI implementations with existing agent ecosystems and avoid conflicting behaviors

5. **Current Technology Documentation (Required for Reliability)**
   - **Context7 MCP Tool (Mandatory)**: Must be used for accessing current, authoritative technology documentation
     Context7 usage requirements:
     - Framework documentation (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
     - Cloud platform documentation (AWS, GCP, Azure)
     - Development tool documentation (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
     - Library and package documentation matching project dependencies
     - Always verify version compatibility with project requirements
   - **WebTool MCP Tool (Mandatory when Context7 unavailable)**: Must be used to ensure documentation currency and reliability
     WebTool usage requirements:
     - Official documentation sites only (no third-party or unofficial sources)
     - Version-specific documentation that matches exact project dependencies
     - Authoritative community resources (official GitHub repos, maintainer blogs)
     - Always cross-reference with codebase implementation patterns

6. **Context Synthesis Requirements**
   - **Evidence Hierarchy**: Codebase evidence > User examples > AI agent context > Repository documentation > Current technology documentation (Context7/WebTool)
   - **Cross-Validation Protocol**: Verify all recommendations against existing codebase patterns, established AI workflows, and current technology best practices
   - **Agent Ecosystem Alignment**: Ensure new implementations complement rather than conflict with existing AI agent configurations and behaviors
   - **Technology Currency Validation**: Use Context7/WebTool to confirm implementation patterns align with current best practices and prevent outdated guidance
   - **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing context and specify additional information requirements with specific MCP tool recommendations
   - **Uncertainty Documentation**: Explicitly state when information is insufficient or requires additional verification through systematic analysis

**Critical Requirements**:

- PRP execution must begin with comprehensive codebase analysis using repomix
- AI agent context analysis is mandatory to prevent workflow conflicts  
- Technology documentation verification through Context7/WebTool is required for all external dependencies
- Current documentation ensures recommendations align with latest best practices and established project patterns

## Rules

### Universal Rules (Apply to All PRPs)

#### Anti-Hallucination Protocol

All PRP implementations must implement rigorous verification and grounding measures:

##### Evidence Requirements

- **Concrete Citations**: Every technical assertion must include specific file:line references with direct code excerpts
- **Current Documentation Grounding**: Use Context7/WebTool MCP tools to verify all technology claims against authoritative, up-to-date sources
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-reference findings across codebase evidence, AI agent configurations, and current documentation

##### Uncertainty Handling Standards

- **Explicit Acknowledgment**: When information is insufficient, state clearly: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess [specific aspect]. Additional [specific data type] would be required for accurate analysis."
- **Confidence Calibration**: Use specific language for different certainty levels:
  - High confidence: "Based on analysis of [specific evidence]..."
  - Medium confidence: "The available evidence suggests [conclusion], though [specific limitation]..."
  - Low confidence: "Limited evidence indicates [tentative conclusion]; verification through [specific method] would be needed"

##### Source Verification Hierarchy

1. **Primary Sources**: Existing codebase with file:line evidence
2. **High Priority Sources**: User examples, AI agent context, current technology documentation (Context7/WebTool)
3. **Secondary Sources**: Repository documentation, configuration files, historical context

##### Knowledge Boundaries

- **Scope Limitations**: Explicitly acknowledge when questions fall outside expertise areas
- **Referral Protocols**: Direct users to appropriate resources or specialists when boundaries are reached
- **No Speculation**: Never supplement analysis with unverified external knowledge or assumptions

#### Response Structure Requirements

All PRP responses must follow structured, hierarchical organization following Anthropic best practices:

##### XML Organization Framework

- **Semantic Structure**: Use clear XML tags for logical organization (`<analysis>`, `<findings>`, `<recommendations>`, `<implementation>`, `<verification>`)
- **Hierarchical Content**: Nest related information within appropriate parent tags for clarity
- **Consistent Naming**: Apply uniform tag conventions across all responses for predictability

##### Citation and Evidence Standards  

- **File References**: Include complete citations in format `[filename:line-range]` with direct code excerpts
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combine evidence from codebase, AI agent configs, and current documentation
- **Source Attribution**: Clearly identify whether information comes from static analysis, dynamic verification, or external documentation

##### Logical Flow Requirements

- **Sequential Structure**: Follow evidence gathering → analysis → recommendations → implementation → validation sequence
- **Clear Transitions**: Use explicit connectors between sections to maintain logical coherence
- **Progressive Detail**: Start with high-level findings, then provide implementation-specific details

##### Boundary Communication

- **Explicit Limitations**: State capability boundaries upfront when relevant to the query
- **Referral Guidance**: Provide specific next steps when expertise limits are reached
- **Confidence Indicators**: Include confidence levels for different aspects of the analysis

#### Quality Assurance Standards

- **Technical Precision**: Use specific version numbers, configuration parameters, and measurable success criteria
- **Implementation Specificity**: Provide actionable guidance with concrete examples and execution steps
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all recommendations align with existing codebase patterns and constraints
- **Iterative Improvement**: Build upon previous analysis with explicit connections and progressive refinement

### Context Gathering Rules

#### Repository Analysis Protocol

All context engineering operations must begin with systematic repository analysis using the following sequence:

1. **Directory Structure Discovery**
   - Execute `tree docs/` to inspect documentation structure and context availability
   - Execute `tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|__pycache__|*.pyc'` for comprehensive project structure

2. **Mandatory Repomix Codebase Analysis**
   - **Tool Validation**: Execute `command -v repomix` or `which repomix` to verify installation
     - **Fallback Check**: Verify `~/.local/bin/repomix` or `./node_modules/.bin/repomix` if not in PATH
     - **Critical Requirement**: Process cannot proceed without functional repomix installation

   - **Capabilities Discovery**: Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and output formats

   - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Execute repomix with optimal configuration based on repository context:
     - **Standard Command**: `repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-empty-lines -o analysis.md`
     - **Large Repositories**: `repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories` for structure-only analysis
     - **Custom Filtering**: Use `--ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules"` to exclude noise files as needed
     - **Configuration Override**: Use `-o filename.md` to override config settings when needed

   - **Complete Analysis Requirement**: Read the entire generated repomix output file to extract:
     - File summary sections and processing metadata
     - Directory structure with full ASCII tree visualization  
     - Complete file classification and technology stack identification
     - Configuration patterns and development workflow analysis
     - Security findings and compliance notes

3. **Anti-Hallucination Protocol**
   - Base all technical claims on concrete file:line references from repomix output
   - When information is insufficient: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this. Additional [specific data type] would be required for accurate analysis."
   - NEVER supplement analysis with external knowledge unless explicitly requested

**Critical Enforcement**: Failure to complete repomix analysis before proceeding with context engineering tasks is a blocking condition. All subsequent analysis must reference and build upon the repomix findings.
