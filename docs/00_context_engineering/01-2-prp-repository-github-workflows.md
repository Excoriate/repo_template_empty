# Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) - GitHub Repository Workflows

## Context Engineering

This document is a **Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)** based on the PRP system, and it's a core component of Context Engineering, which transforms high-level feature requests into comprehensive implementation blueprints for AI assistants, with deep context and awareness about the codebase, user examples, and current technology documentation.

### Dependencies

**Prerequisite Requirements**:
- **Required PRP**: Codebase Analysis PRP (00-prp-codebase-analysis.md) must be completed with output at `docs/00_context_engineering/initial_context/00_codebase_analysis/`
- **Required PRP**: GitHub Repository Configuration PRP (01.1-prp-repository-github-configure.md) must be completed with repository settings properly configured
- **Analysis Dependency**: Repository structure analysis must exist with technology stack identification, dependency mapping, and project context analysis in `docs/00_context_engineering/initial_context/00_codebase_analysis/codebase-analysis-repomix.md` and `docs/00_context_engineering/initial_context/00_codebase_analysis/codebase-analysis.md`
- **Configuration Dependency**: GitHub repository settings must be configured with proper branch protection rules, security settings, and team access patterns from the repository configuration PRP
- **Validation Method**: Verify existence of both codebase analysis files and completed repository configuration before proceeding with workflow creation. Check for technology stack identification, project description analysis, and dependency information required for accurate workflow generation.
- **Missing Dependency Action**: Execute prerequisite PRPs in order: Codebase Analysis → Repository Configuration → Workflows. Workflow creation cannot proceed without comprehensive understanding of the codebase structure, technology stack, and repository governance settings.

### Purpose for this PRP

**Context Purpose Statement**:
This PRP provides comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow creation and management for DevOps Engineers and Repository Administrators to establish essential CI/CD workflows through automated GitHub Actions configuration, leveraging up-to-date documentation from Context7 and web sources to ensure current best practices and compatibility.

    A[Workflow Operation Required] --> B{Workflow Exists?}
    B -->|No| C[Create New Workflow]
    B -->|Yes| D[Assess Current Configuration]
    D --> E{Workflow Current?}
    E -->|Yes| F[No Action - Already Current]
    E -->|No| G{Preserve Custom Changes?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Merge Custom + Updated Standards]
    G -->|No| I[Update to Current Standards]
    
    C --> J[Apply Current Best Practices]
    H --> K[Validate Workflow Syntax]
    I --> K
    J --> K
    F --> L[Report: Workflows Current]
    K --> M[Report: Workflows Updated]
```

**3. Workflow File Operation Logic**
- **Workflow Files**: Compare `.github/workflows/*.yml` content with current best practices, update only if different
- **Action Versions**: Check action versions against latest releases, update only if outdated
- **Security Practices**: Validate workflows against current security guidelines, apply missing protections
- **Technology Integration**: Ensure workflows match detected technology stack from codebase analysis

### Domain-Specific Idempotency Requirements

**Flow Description**: This PRP follows a systematic 5-step workflow for GitHub Actions workflow creation. It begins with mandatory real-time documentation refresh using Context7 and web sources, proceeds through comprehensive repository and technology analysis, creates essential basic workflows for repository management, generates technology-specific CI/CD workflows based on detected stack, and concludes with comprehensive validation and deployment. Each step builds upon current best practices and ensures optimal workflow performance.

### Step 1: Real-Time Documentation Refresh and Tool Validation

<step>

**Action**: **MANDATORY** - Refresh GitHub Actions documentation using Context7 and web sources to ensure current best practices, action versions, and security guidelines

**Process**:
1. **Context7 Documentation Access**: Access GitHub Actions starter workflows and current patterns
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Fetch current GitHub Actions documentation
   context7 get-library-docs "/actions/starter-workflows" --topic "basic workflows" --tokens 5000
   context7 get-library-docs "/actions/checkout" --topic "repository checkout" --tokens 3000
   context7 get-library-docs "/actions/setup-node" --topic "node.js setup" --tokens 3000
   ```
2. **Web Documentation Retrieval**: Access official GitHub Actions documentation for current syntax and security practices
   ```bash
   # Fetch current action versions from GitHub API
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/actions/setup-node/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/docker/setup-buildx-action/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'
   ```
3. **Security Guidelines Integration**: Retrieve current GitHub Actions security best practices
   ```bash
   # Access current security documentation
   curl -s "https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions"
   ```

**Expected Result**: Current GitHub Actions documentation, action versions, and security guidelines cached for workflow generation

**Verification**: Successful retrieval of current documentation with validated action versions and security practices

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: 
- If Context7 access fails, verify Context7 installation and authentication
- For API rate limiting, implement request throttling and caching mechanisms
- If documentation retrieval fails, fall back to cached versions with clear version warnings
- For security guideline access issues, use backup documentation sources with version validation

### Step 2: Repository Analysis and Technology Integration

<step>

**Action**: Analyze repository structure, integrate codebase analysis results, and validate repository configuration for workflow requirements

**Process**:
1. **Codebase Analysis Integration**: Extract technology stack information from prerequisite PRP results
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Verify codebase analysis dependency
   ls -la docs/00_context_engineering/initial_context/00_codebase_analysis/
   # Extract technology stack information
   grep -E "Primary Language|Framework|Build System" \
     docs/00_context_engineering/initial_context/00_codebase_analysis/codebase-analysis.md
   ```
2. **Repository Configuration Review**: Validate repository settings from prerequisite PRP
   ```bash
   # Verify repository configuration dependency
   cat .github/settings.yml | grep -E "required_status_checks|branch_protection"
   # Extract required status checks for workflow integration
   ```
3. **Technology Stack Detection**: Identify specific technology requirements for workflow generation
   ```bash
   # Detect Docker configuration
   [[ -f "Dockerfile" ]] && echo "Docker detected"
   [[ -f "docker-compose.yml" ]] && echo "Docker Compose detected"
   
   # Detect language-specific configurations
   [[ -f "package.json" ]] && echo "Node.js detected"
   [[ -f "requirements.txt" ]] && echo "Python detected"
   [[ -f "Cargo.toml" ]] && echo "Rust detected"
   [[ -f "go.mod" ]] && echo "Go detected"
   ```

**Expected Result**: Complete technology stack identification with repository configuration integration for accurate workflow generation

**Verification**: Documented technology requirements with validated repository settings and dependency confirmation

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: 
- For missing codebase analysis, execute prerequisite PRP first with clear dependency messaging
- If repository configuration is incomplete, validate prerequisite PRP completion before proceeding
- For unclear technology stack detection, examine additional configuration files and build scripts
- If dependency validation fails, provide specific guidance on prerequisite PRP execution order

### Step 3: Basic Repository Management Workflows Creation

<step>

**Action**: Create essential repository management workflows including issue management, thread locking, and stale content management using current best practices

**Process**:
1. **Issue Management Workflow**: Create automated issue comment handling workflow
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/issue-management.yml
   name: 📋 Issue Management
   
   on:
     issues:
       types: [opened, edited, closed, reopened]
     issue_comment:
       types: [created, edited]
   
   jobs:
     manage-issues:
       name: 🏷️ Manage Issue Labels and Responses
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: 📥 Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Current version from documentation refresh
         
         - name: 🏷️ Auto-label Issues
           uses: github/super-linter@v5
           # Implementation based on current best practices
   ```
2. **Thread Locking Automation**: Create workflow for automatic thread locking after inactivity
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/lock-threads.yml
   name: 🔒 Lock Inactive Threads
   
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily execution
   
   jobs:
     lock-threads:
       name: 🔒 Lock Inactive Issues and PRs
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: 🔒 Lock Threads
           uses: dessant/lock-threads@v4  # Current version from documentation
           with:
             github-token: ${{ github.token }}
             issue-inactive-days: '30'
             pr-inactive-days: '30'
   ```
3. **Stale Content Management**: Create workflow for stale issue and PR management
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/stale-management.yml
   name: 🏷️ Stale Content Management
   
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 12 * * *'  # Daily at noon
   
   jobs:
     stale:
       name: 🏷️ Mark Stale Issues and PRs
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: 🏷️ Stale Action
           uses: actions/stale@v8  # Current version from documentation refresh
           with:
             repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             stale-issue-message: 'This issue has been automatically marked as stale.'
             stale-pr-message: 'This PR has been automatically marked as stale.'
   ```

**Expected Result**: Complete set of basic repository management workflows with current action versions and best practices

**Verification**: All basic workflows validate syntax and integrate with repository configuration requirements

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: 
- For workflow syntax errors, validate YAML formatting and GitHub Actions syntax compliance
- If action versions are outdated, re-run documentation refresh step to get current versions
- For permission issues, verify GitHub token scopes and repository settings
- If workflow integration conflicts occur, review repository configuration and branch protection rules

### Step 4: Technology-Specific Workflow Generation

<step>

**Action**: Generate technology-specific CI/CD workflows based on detected technology stack using current best practices and action versions

**Process**:
1. **Docker CI/CD Workflow**: Create Docker-specific workflow if Dockerfile detected
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml (if Dockerfile present)
   name: 🐳 Docker Build and Test
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     docker-build:
       name: 🏗️ Build and Test Docker Image
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
         - name: 📥 Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Current version
           
         - name: 🐳 Set up Docker Buildx
           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3  # Current version
           
         - name: 🏗️ Build Docker Image
           uses: docker/build-push-action@v5  # Current version
           with:
             context: .
             push: false
             tags: test-image:latest
             cache-from: type=gha
             cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
   ```
2. **Language-Specific Testing**: Create language-appropriate testing workflows
   ```yaml
   # Example: Node.js workflow (if package.json detected)
   name: 🟢 Node.js CI
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       name: 🧪 Test Node.js Application
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       strategy:
         matrix:
           node-version: [18.x, 20.x]  # Current LTS versions
       
       steps:
         - name: 📥 Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           
         - name: 🟢 Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4  # Current version
           with:
             node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
             cache: 'npm'
   ```
3. **Build and Deployment Automation**: Create deployment workflows based on technology requirements
   ```yaml
   # Technology-specific deployment patterns
   # Customized based on detected build systems and deployment targets
   ```

**Expected Result**: Technology-specific workflows optimized for detected stack with current action versions and security practices

**Verification**: All generated workflows match technology requirements and validate against current best practices

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: 
- For unsupported technology stacks, provide generic workflow templates with customization guidance
- If build system detection fails, examine additional configuration files and provide manual configuration options
- For deployment workflow issues, verify target environment requirements and credentials configuration
- If matrix strategy conflicts occur, adjust based on technology version support and repository requirements

### Step 5: Workflow Validation and Deployment

<step>

**Action**: Validate all generated workflows, verify security compliance, and deploy with comprehensive testing

**Process**:
1. **Workflow Syntax Validation**: Validate all generated workflows against GitHub Actions schema
   ```bash
   # Validate YAML syntax for all workflows
   find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" | xargs yamllint
   
   # GitHub Actions specific validation (if act available)
   act --dryrun --workflows .github/workflows/
   ```
2. **Security Compliance Verification**: Verify workflows meet current security guidelines
   ```bash
   # Check for security best practices
   # - No hardcoded secrets
   # - Proper permission scoping
   # - Current action versions
   # - Security scanning integration
   ```
3. **Integration Testing**: Test workflow integration with repository configuration
   ```bash
   # Verify workflows align with branch protection rules
   # Check required status checks configuration
   # Validate team access and permission requirements
   ```
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize workflows for performance and resource usage
   ```bash
   # Review workflow efficiency
   # Optimize caching strategies
   # Minimize job execution time
   # Reduce resource consumption
   ```

**Expected Result**: Fully validated, secure, and optimized GitHub Actions workflows ready for production deployment

**Verification**: All workflows pass validation, security compliance, and integration testing with documented performance metrics

</step>

**Troubleshooting**: 
- For validation failures, review workflow syntax and GitHub Actions schema compliance
- If security compliance issues arise, update workflows with current security best practices
- For integration conflicts, review repository configuration and adjust workflow requirements
- If performance issues occur, optimize caching, parallelization, and resource allocation

### Workflow Categories and Templates

Based on systematic analysis and current best practices, the PRP generates workflows in two main categories:

#### Basic Workflows (Mandatory)

These workflows are created for every repository regardless of technology stack:

**1. Issue Management Workflow** (`issue-management.yml`)
```yaml
name: 📋 Issue and PR Management

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  manage-issues:
    name: 🏷️ Manage Issues and PRs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
      
    steps:
      - name: 📥 Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: 🏷️ Auto-label Based on Content
        uses: github/super-linter@v5

            Our team will review it soon. Please make sure you've followed our contribution guidelines.
            `;
            
            if (context.eventName === 'issues') {
              github.rest.issues.createComment({
                issue_number: context.issue.number,

- All outputs must include evidence-based validation and troubleshooting guidance for operational excellence
- Workflow deployment must verify successful syntax validation and integration with repository settings

---

## Rules

### Universal Rules (Apply to All PRPs)

### Anti-Hallucination Protocol

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Every technical assertion must include specific GitHub Actions references with direct action version citations from Context7 and web sources
- Use real-time documentation validation to verify workflow claims against current GitHub Actions capabilities and best practices
- Cross-reference findings across repository analysis, technology detection, and security requirements patterns

**Uncertainty Handling**:
- When information is insufficient: "I don't have enough current information to confidently assess [specific workflow pattern]. Additional [Context7/web documentation access] would be required for accurate analysis."
- Use calibrated confidence language:
  - High confidence: "Based on current GitHub Actions documentation from [Context7/web source]..."
  - Medium confidence: "Available workflow patterns suggest [conclusion], though [specific limitation from documentation]..."
  - Low confidence: "Limited current evidence indicates [tentative conclusion]; verification through [specific Context7 lookup] needed"

**Source Verification Hierarchy**:
1. Current GitHub Actions documentation from Context7 and web sources with action version validation
2. Repository configuration, technology stack analysis, and security requirements from prerequisite PRPs
3. Repository documentation, existing workflows, and historical context

**Knowledge Boundaries**:
- Explicitly acknowledge when questions fall outside GitHub Actions workflow scope or current documentation availability
- Direct users to appropriate GitHub Actions documentation when boundaries are reached
- Never supplement analysis with unverified workflow assumptions or outdated action versions

### Specific Rules (Domain: GitHub Actions Workflows)

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Evidence Standards
- **MANDATORY**: All workflow generation must begin with Context7 documentation access using `/actions/starter-workflows` and related libraries for current best practices
- **MANDATORY**: Every workflow implementation must include web-based documentation verification for current action versions and security guidelines
- Workflow configuration analysis must include systematic real-time documentation validation with complete execution verification
- All workflow assertions must reference specific GitHub Actions syntax with direct YAML citations and current action version validation
- Security compliance validation must be supported by current GitHub Actions security guidelines and repository security scanning integration
- Technology-specific workflows must follow current best practices retrieved from up-to-date documentation sources with version compatibility verification

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Quality Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Every PRP execution must refresh GitHub Actions documentation through Context7 and web sources before workflow generation
- **MANDATORY**: All generated workflows must use current action versions verified through real-time documentation access
- Workflow configurations must achieve 100% syntax validation and security compliance with current GitHub Actions standards
- Technology-specific workflows must integrate seamlessly with detected technology stack and repository configuration requirements
- All workflows must be optimized for performance, security, and maintainability using current best practices from live documentation sources
- Workflow deployment must follow systematic validation protocols to ensure accuracy and prevent security gaps or execution failures

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Integration Protocols
- **MANDATORY**: All workflow creation operations must integrate current GitHub Actions capabilities retrieved through Context7 and web documentation access
- **MANDATORY**: Technology-specific workflows must align with codebase analysis results and repository configuration settings from prerequisite PRPs
- All repository workflow configurations must integrate with existing DevOps workflows and CI/CD pipeline requirements using current integration patterns
- Workflow management must maintain compatibility with organizational security policies and compliance frameworks verified through current documentation
- Repository automation must be structured for optimal team collaboration while maintaining security compliance and audit trail requirements using current GitHub Actions features
- Workflow deployment must follow systematic validation protocols with real-time documentation verification to ensure accuracy and prevent integration conflicts

### Enhanced Implementation Guidelines

#### Real-Time Documentation Integration Best Practices
Based on the mandatory requirement for current documentation access:

1. **Context7 Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Always fetch current GitHub Actions documentation
   context7 get-library-docs "/actions/starter-workflows" --topic "basic workflows" --tokens 5000
   context7 get-library-docs "/actions/checkout" --topic "repository checkout" --tokens 3000
   ```

2. **Web Documentation Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify current action versions
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/actions/setup-node/releases/latest" | jq -r '.tag_name'
   ```

3. **Security Guidelines Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Access current security best practices
   curl -s "https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions"
   ```

#### Error Prevention and Recovery
- **Documentation Access Issues**: Always verify Context7 availability and web connectivity before workflow generation
- **Action Version Conflicts**: Re-fetch current documentation if workflow generation encounters deprecated action versions
- **Technology Detection Failures**: Integrate codebase analysis results systematically with validation of prerequisite PRP completion
- **Repository Configuration Misalignment**: Validate repository settings from prerequisite PRP before workflow creation
- **Workflow Syntax Errors**: Use systematic YAML validation and GitHub Actions schema compliance checking
- **Security Compliance Gaps**: Apply current GitHub Actions security guidelines retrieved from real-time documentation sources
- **Integration Conflicts**: Verify workflow requirements against repository configuration and branch protection rules
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize workflows using current best practices for caching, parallelization, and resource efficiency
