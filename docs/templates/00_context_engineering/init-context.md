# Initial Context Engineering: {{repository_name}}

> **💡 Context Engineering Note:** This document provides comprehensive repository context for AI assistants, AI Agents, and Developers/Maintainers using proven context engineering methodologies. As highlighted by industry leaders in 2025, context engineering represents a fundamental shift from experimental AI use to enterprise-grade AI operations, providing 10x better accuracy and 100x fewer production failures compared to traditional "vibe coding" approaches. It serves as the foundation for understanding the complete project landscape and enables generation of detailed architecture, tech stack, reference documentation, and other downstream documents.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has emerged as the dominant methodology in AI development, representing a paradigm shift from simple prompt crafting to comprehensive information architecture design. As noted by [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/context-engineering-is-the-new-vibe-coding/), "when LLMs fail, it's not because the model is broken — it's because the system around it didn't set it up for success."

### Key Components of Context Engineering

**Information Ecosystem Management:**

- **System Instructions and Role Definitions**: Clear, structured directives that define AI behavior and capabilities
- **Conversation History and Memory Management**: Tracking past interactions to maintain coherence and build upon previous context
- **Relevant Documents and Knowledge Base**: Curated external knowledge injection with proper prioritization and chunking
- **Tool Outputs and API Integration**: Real-time data from external systems integrated seamlessly into context
- **Structured Information Architecture**: Organizing data to fit within token constraints while maximizing relevance

**Systems-Level Approach:**
Unlike prompt engineering's focus on individual interactions, context engineering orchestrates multiple layers of information to create a dynamic, intelligent environment. This approach transforms AI from simple responders into intelligent collaborators capable of understanding nuance, user preferences, and complex workflows.

### Context Engineering vs. Traditional Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Methodology | Outcomes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Individual instructions | Crafting better prompts | Variable results, limited scalability |
| **Vibe Coding** | Intuitive AI interaction | "Feeling your way" through tasks | Experimental, high failure rate |
| **Context Engineering** | Information ecosystem | Systematic framework design | Enterprise-grade reliability, scalable AI operations |

## Operational Protocol & Consistency Mandate

For you, 🤖 AI agent - Your primary function is to execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to the protocols outlined below. This is not a guide; it is your operational mandate. Each section must be processed in sequence, using the defined structure and validation checks.

### Execution Structure

Every section in this document adheres to the following mandatory structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions**: This block contains your direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute them precisely.
- **⬇️ Expected Outcomes**: This block defines the required output. You MUST generate all specified artifacts to mark the section as complete. Your output must be validated against these outcomes.
- **📋 Template Variables**: This block lists variables (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`) that require substitution. You MUST replace them with the correct values from the established context.

### Critical Document Consistency Framework

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Interdependent Sections Consistency Requirements**
>
> This document contains interdependent sections that must maintain consistency to ensure coherent context engineering. Each section builds upon previous sections and informs subsequent ones. You are required to follow these consistency protocols without deviation.

#### Mandatory Cross-Section Dependencies

**Primary Dependencies (Critical):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture): The system architecture must support all MVP Features and capabilities.
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 5 (Software Architecture): The MVP Sequence Diagram must implement the Primary Use Cases from MVP Features.
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 6 (UX): UX patterns and flows must support all defined features and target users.
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 5 (Software Architecture): Software components must implement architectural decisions and constraints.
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 11 (Deployment): Deployment architecture must support system architecture choices.
- Section 8 (Tech Stack) → Section 7 (Implementation Requirements): All requirements must be feasible with chosen technologies.
- Section 8 (Tech Stack) → Section 9 (Third Party Integrations): All integrations must be compatible with chosen tech stack.
- Section 8 (Tech Stack) → Section 10 (Local Development Setup): Setup procedures must use exact versions from Tech Stack.
- Section 8 (Tech Stack) → Section 12 (AI Assistant Guidance): AI pitfalls must be relevant to chosen technologies.
- Section 8 (Tech Stack) → Section 13 (Reference & Documentation): Documentation must support all chosen technologies.

**Secondary Dependencies (Important):**
- Section 5 (Software Architecture) → Section 7 (Implementation Requirements): Requirements must align with software architectural decisions.
- Section 6 (UX) → Section 7 (Implementation Requirements): UX requirements must align with technical implementation constraints.
- Section 7 (Implementation Requirements) → Section 10 (Local Development Setup): External service setup must align with integration specifications.
- Section 7 (Implementation Requirements) → Section 12 (AI Assistant Guidance): Behavioral guidance must incorporate technical constraints.
- Section 9 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 10 (Local Development Setup): Setup must include third-party service configuration.
- Section 9 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 11 (Deployment): Deployment must support third-party integration requirements.
- Section 9 (Third Party Integrations) → Section 12 (AI Assistant Guidance): AI guidance must address third-party integration pitfalls.

**Coherence Dependencies (Application-Type Specific):**
- Section 3 (Features) → Section 4 (Architecture): Architecture components must be coherent with application type (CLI, web, API, library).
- Section 4 (Architecture) → Section 6 (UX): UX section applicability must align with architectural frontend decisions.
- Section 6 (UX) → Section 8 (Tech Stack): UX technologies must support defined user experience patterns.
- Section 11 (Deployment) → Section 4 (Architecture): Deployment strategy must be coherent with system architecture type.

#### Consistency Enforcement Protocol

**Before completing any section, you MUST:**

1. **Read Dependencies:** Completely read all sections referenced in the current section's requirements.
2. **Validate Alignment:** Ensure all generated content aligns with the established context from referenced sections.
3. **Verify Coherence:** Cross-check all interdependent elements for logical consistency.
4. **Iterate if Needed:** If inconsistencies are detected, you must revise the content until full consistency is achieved.

#### Section-Specific Consistency Guidelines

- **For sections with dependencies:** Each section's `NOTE` block includes specific cross-reference requirements. Follow the detailed validation steps provided. Ensure all template variables are used consistently.
- **For sections without dependencies:** Focus on the section-specific requirements and ensure the output supports downstream dependent sections.

#### Consistency Failure Prevention

**You MUST avoid the following common consistency failures:**

- Creating system architecture without referencing the actual application type and MVP features.
- Creating sequence diagrams that do not map to the Primary Use Cases in Section 3.
- Defining UX patterns for applications without user interfaces (e.g., CLI tools, APIs).
- Including frontend architecture components for non-UI applications.
- Defining implementation requirements incompatible with the chosen tech stack.
- Documenting third-party integrations without corresponding tech stack support.
- Writing setup procedures that do not match specified technology versions.
- Creating deployment strategies incompatible with the system architecture.
- Documenting AI pitfalls irrelevant to the project's technology choices.

**Application-Type Coherence Failures:**
- **CLI Applications:** Do NOT include traditional frontend architecture or web-based UX patterns.
- **Web Applications:** MUST include both frontend architecture and a comprehensive UX section.
- **API Services:** Do NOT include user interface components or end-user UX patterns.
- **Libraries/SDKs:** Do NOT include deployment sections or end-user UX patterns.

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Before finalizing any section, verify all cross-references are accurate.
- Confirm all interdependent content aligns properly.
- Validate that section outcomes support all dependent sections.
- Verify application-type coherence across architecture, UX, and deployment sections.

## AI Operational Workflow: Document Completion

This section outlines the mandatory workflow you must follow to complete this `init-context.md` document. Your purpose is to act as the primary agent in transforming initial user inputs into a comprehensive, structured, and consistent context document.

This document, once completed, serves as the foundational input for all subsequent documentation and code generation tasks.

### Three-Phase Completion Protocol

You will execute the following three phases in sequence. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and validated.

**Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis**
Your first step is to gather and analyze the initial project information provided by the user.

* **Action:** Process the inputs from the user, which may include responses to a helper prompt, direct instructions, or example files.
* **Process:**
    1.  Analyze all provided materials to establish a foundational understanding of the project's purpose, scope, and technical stack.
    2.  If repository analysis tools (e.g., `repomix`) are available, execute them to get a structural overview of the codebase.
    3.  Synthesize this initial data to prepare for populating the sections below.
* **Output:** A preliminary, in-memory model of the project's key attributes.

**Phase 2: Structured Content Generation**
Your primary task is to systematically populate each numbered section of this document, from "1. Initial Codebase Awareness" to "13. Reference & Documentation".

* **Action:** For each section, generate the required content based on the established context.
* **Process:**
    1.  Adhere strictly to the **🤖 AI Assistant Instructions** provided in each section.
    2.  Generate all artifacts specified in the **⬇️ Expected Outcomes** block for each section.
    3.  Strictly follow the **Critical Document Consistency Framework** by cross-referencing dependent sections to ensure coherence.
* **Output:** A fully populated `init-context.md` document.

**Phase 3: Final Validation**
Before concluding, you must perform a final validation pass on the entire document.

* **Action:** Review the completed document for internal consistency and adherence to all protocols.
* **Process:**
    1.  Verify that all mandatory cross-section dependencies are met.
    2.  Check for any application-type coherence failures (e.g., a CLI tool having a web UX section).
    3.  Ensure all `{{template_variables}}` have been correctly substituted.
* **Output:** A validated, final version of `init-context.md` ready for use in downstream tasks.

### Workflow Rationale

This phased approach ensures a systematic and rigorous process. By separating initial analysis from content generation and final validation, it minimizes errors, prevents context-drift, and guarantees that the final document is a reliable and coherent foundation for any subsequent AI-driven development tasks.

## Context Engineering Initial Context

### 1. Initial Codebase Awareness

> [!NOTE]
> **🤖 Instructions for AI Assistant:**
>
> **📋 Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**
>
> ```
> 1. 🔧 VALIDATE TOOL → Verify `repomix` is installed and executable.
> 2. 🔍 DISCOVER → Run `repomix --help` to understand tool capabilities.
> 3. 📊 ANALYZE → Execute `repomix` to get the complete codebase structure.
> 4. 🌳 EXTRACT & CATALOG → Generate ASCII tree and create a table of ALL initial files.
> 5. 📝 SYNTHESIZE & PRESENT → Produce a comprehensive summary based on the analysis.
> ```
>
> **🔧 Detailed Steps:**
>
> - **Tool Validation:** Execute `command -v repomix`. If the tool is not found, report an error and halt. This step is mandatory.
> - **Tool Discovery:** Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and the expected output format.
> - **Codebase Analysis:** Run `repomix` on the current directory to perform a comprehensive structural analysis.
> - **Initial State Cataloging:**
>     - From the `repomix` output, generate a complete ASCII directory tree.
>     - Create a table listing **all** discovered files. For new repositories, every file is relevant.
>     - For each file, classify its type (e.g., `dotfile`, `configuration`, `task-runner`, `documentation`) and infer its purpose based on conventions (`.gitignore` ignores files, `Justfile` defines tasks, etc.).
> - **Synthesize Analysis:** Write a brief narrative summary that interprets the structured findings (the tree and table). This summary should state the inferred project status (e.g., "newly initialized," "template-based") and highlight the purpose of the existing tooling.
> - 🚫 **Constraint:** Do not perform a deep analysis of file *contents*. The focus is on structure, configuration, and tooling at this stage.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - `repomix` command is successfully validated before proceeding.
> - ASCII tree accurately represents the repository's initial file structure.
> - The "Initial Files" table is exhaustive for the new repository state.
> - The final analysis is a direct synthesis of the tree and table, not new information.

#### Output Format

**Repomix Tool Capabilities:**
```bash
# Output from repomix --help command
(Tool capabilities, options, and usage information)
```

**Complete Codebase Structure:**
```
(ASCII tree representation of the repository structure from repomix output)
```

**Initial Files Catalog:**
| File/Directory | Type | Inferred Purpose & Configuration Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (e.g., .gitignore) | dotfile | Standard Git ignore file. Configured to ignore node_modules, .env, etc. |
| (e.g., Justfile) | task-runner | Defines project automation tasks. Contains recipes for build, test, lint. |
| (e.g., README.md) | documentation | Project's primary documentation file. Currently contains initial template text. |

**Initial Codebase Synthesis:**
(A concise, 1-2 paragraph summary interpreting the findings above.)

Example Synthesis:
"The repository {{repository_name}} appears to be newly initialized from a project template. The structure includes standard configuration files such as .gitignore and a README.md. A Justfile is present, indicating that project tasks like building and testing are intended to be managed via the just task runner. The initial state suggests the project is set up for [Language/Framework] development but contains no application source code yet."

> - **Configuration Synthesis:**
>     - Use the user's input as the primary source for the configuration.
>     - For any settings *not* specified by the user, apply the default best practices defined in the schema below (e.g., `require_code_owner_reviews: true`).
>     - Auto-infer technology-specific `labels` and CI/CD `contexts` based on the tech stack that will be defined in Section 8. Use placeholders if the stack is currently unknown.
> - **YAML Generation:** Create a single, complete `settings.yml` configuration block in memory. **You MUST substitute all `{{template_variables}}` with their actual values.**
> - **File Operation:**
>     - Check if `.github/settings.yml` exists.
>     - If it exists, update it with the generated configuration.
>     - If it does not exist, create the file at `.github/settings.yml` and write the generated configuration to it.
> - **Summary Table Generation:** After creating the final YAML, generate the "Repository Summary Table" as a high-level view.
>
> **✅ Validation Requirements:**
>
> - The generated YAML MUST be syntactically correct.
