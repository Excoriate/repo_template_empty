<rules>

## Rules

<instructions>
### Instructions

#### 1. Document Completion Protocol

You MUST execute the completion of this document by adhering strictly to these protocols. This is your operational mandate - each section must be processed in sequence using the defined structure and validation checks.

#### 2. Mandatory Section Structure

Every section in this document follows this structure. You MUST parse and act upon each component:

- **ü§ñ AI Assistant Instructions**: Direct, non-negotiable instructions for the section. Execute precisely.
- **‚¨áÔ∏è Expected Outcomes**: Required output specifications. Generate ALL specified artifacts to mark section complete.
- **üìã Template Variables**: Variables requiring substitution (e.g., `{{repository_name}}`). Replace with correct values.

#### 3. Sequential Processing Requirements

Process sections in exact order without skipping. Do not proceed to next section until current section is complete and validated.

#### 4. Evidence-Based Analysis

All technical claims MUST include:

- Concrete file:line references with exact paths
- Direct quotes from source files when making assertions
- Systematic tool usage with documented verification steps
- Cross-validation of findings across multiple sources

#### 5. Anti-Hallucination Protocol

You are EXPLICITLY PERMITTED and ENCOURAGED to admit uncertainty. When you encounter:

- Insufficient information to make confident assessments
- Ambiguous or unclear repository structures
- Missing documentation or configuration files
- Technical details beyond your current analysis scope

You MUST respond with: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this. Additional [specific type of information] would be required for accurate analysis."

#### 6. Factual Grounding Requirements

For all repository analysis tasks:

- FIRST extract direct quotes from relevant files before making claims
- ALWAYS cite specific file:line references for every technical assertion
- NEVER make assumptions about code functionality without examining actual implementation
- When referencing configuration or documentation, quote exact text from source files

#### 7. External Knowledge Restriction

You MUST ONLY use information from:

- Files within the provided repository
- Tool outputs from repository analysis commands
- User-provided context and instructions

Do NOT supplement analysis with external knowledge about frameworks, tools, or technologies unless explicitly requested. Base all conclusions on observable evidence within the repository.
</instructions>

<constraints>
### Constraints

#### What You Must NOT Do

- Skip validation requirements or success criteria verification
- Make assumptions about repository structure without tool-based confirmation
- Generate template variables without actual context substitution
- Proceed with incomplete section artifacts
- Use vague or unverified technical claims
- Provide analysis without showing your reasoning process
- Make claims about code functionality without examining implementation
- Skip verification steps when analyzing complex repository structures

#### Verification Protocol

For every significant analysis or conclusion, you MUST:

1. **Show Your Work**: Use `<thinking>` tags to demonstrate step-by-step reasoning
2. **Verify Claims**: After making any technical assertion, verify it by finding supporting evidence
3. **Cross-Reference**: Validate findings against multiple sources within the repository
4. **Self-Correct**: If you cannot find supporting evidence for a claim, retract it immediately

Use this format for verification:
```
<thinking>
I claim that [specific assertion]. Let me verify this by:
1. Checking [specific file/location]
2. Looking for [specific evidence]
3. Cross-referencing with [related files]
</thinking>

Based on evidence from [file:line], I can confirm [verified claim].
```
</constraints>

<workflow>
### Workflow

#### Three-Phase Execution Protocol

##### Phase 1: Context Priming and Analysis

<step number="1">
**Action**: Process user inputs and repository information
**Process**:
1. Analyze all provided materials for project understanding
2. Execute repository analysis tools (repomix) for structural overview
3. Synthesize data for downstream section population
**Output**: Preliminary project model ready for structured content generation
</step>

##### Phase 2: Structured Content Generation

<step number="2">
**Action**: Systematically populate each numbered section
**Process**:
1. Follow AI Assistant Instructions precisely for each section
2. Generate all Expected Outcomes artifacts with verification
3. Maintain PRP document coherence through cross-referencing
**Output**: Fully populated document with validated content
</step>

##### Phase 3: Final Validation

<step number="3">
**Action**: Comprehensive document review for consistency and completeness
**Process**:
1. Verify all cross-section dependencies are satisfied
2. Check application-type coherence (no CLI tools with web UX sections)
3. Confirm all template variables are properly substituted
**Output**: Validated, production-ready context engineering document
</step>

#### Response Structure Protocol

ALL responses MUST follow this XML-structured format for maximum clarity:

```xml
<analysis>
  <verification>
    [Your step-by-step verification process]
  </verification>
  
  <findings>
    [Direct quotes and file:line references]
  </findings>
  
  <conclusion>
    [Evidence-based conclusions only]
  </conclusion>
</analysis>
```

#### Context Requirements

Before providing any analysis, you MUST establish:

- **Repository Scope**: What files and directories you have access to
- **Analysis Boundaries**: What aspects you can and cannot assess
- **Tool Limitations**: What analysis tools are available and their constraints
- **Information Gaps**: What information is missing for complete analysis

State these explicitly using:
```xml
<context_assessment>
  <scope>[Available files and directories]</scope>
  <boundaries>[Analysis limitations]</boundaries>
  <tools>[Available analysis capabilities]</tools>
  <gaps>[Missing information needed]</gaps>
</context_assessment>
```
</workflow>
</rules>

## 1. Initial Codebase Awareness

### AI Assistant Instructions

**Process Flow - Follow these steps in order:**

```
1. üîß VALIDATE TOOL ‚Üí Verify `repomix` is installed and executable.
2. üîç DISCOVER ‚Üí Run `repomix --help` to understand tool capabilities.
3. üìä ANALYZE ‚Üí Execute `repomix` to get the complete codebase structure.

6. üìù CREATE OVERVIEW DOC ‚Üí Generate 00-codebase-awareness-overview.md with complete repo summary.
7. ‚úÖ VALIDATE & PRESENT ‚Üí Ensure both artifacts are complete and ready for downstream use.
```

### Detailed Implementation Steps

**Tool Validation:** Execute `command -v repomix` or `which repomix`. If the tool is not found, report an error and halt. This step is mandatory.

- **Fallback Check**: If `repomix` is not in PATH, check common installation locations: `~/.local/bin/repomix`, `./node_modules/.bin/repomix`
- **Installation Verification**: Run `repomix --version` to confirm the tool is executable

**Tool Discovery:** Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and output formats.

**Comprehensive Codebase Analysis:** Execute `repomix` with appropriate flags based on the repository context:

- **Primary Command (Recommended)**: `repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-empty-lines -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-analysis.md`
  - This provides comprehensive markdown output with clean formatting and compression
  - Includes full file contents, directory structure, and metadata
  - Uses Git change count sorting by default (most changed files at bottom)
- **For Large Repositories**: `repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-structure.md`
  - This generates structure-only output (no file contents) for faster analysis when full content isn't needed
- **For Deep Analysis**: `repomix --style markdown -o docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-full.md`
  - Uncompressed output with full file contents for detailed examination
- **Custom Filtering**: Use `--ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules"` to exclude noise files if needed
- **Config Override Note**: If repository has `repomix.config.json`, use `-o filename.md` to override config settings
- **Completeness Verification**: Ensure the command captures all key repository aspects (directory structure, file metadata, content processing, exclusion patterns)

**Output Processing & Extraction:**

- **Directory Tree Extraction**: From repomix output, locate the "Directory Structure" section and extract the ASCII tree
- **File Inventory Creation**: Parse the file list from repomix output, noting file types and sizes
- **Metadata Analysis**: Extract repository metadata (total files, total size, ignored patterns) from repomix summary

**Initial State Cataloging:**

- Create a complete table listing **all** discovered files with classifications:
  - `dotfile` (.gitignore, .env.example, .github/*, etc.)
  - `configuration` (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
  - `task-runner` (Makefile, Justfile, package.json scripts, etc.)
  - `documentation` (README.md, docs/*, CHANGELOG.md, etc.)
  - `template` (.template files, example configs, scaffolding, etc.)
- **Purpose Inference**: For each file, infer purpose based on standard conventions and file patterns

**Error Handling & Validation:**

- **Verify Complete Output**: Ensure repomix completed successfully (no truncated output or error messages)
- **Validate Structure**: Confirm the directory tree matches expected patterns for the project type
- **Handle Large Repositories**: If output is too large, re-run with `--compress` or `--no-files` flags

**Synthesize Analysis:** Write a brief narrative summary interpreting the structured findings:

- State inferred project status (e.g., "newly initialized," "template-based," "active development")
- Highlight existing tooling and configuration patterns
- Note any unusual or non-standard repository structure

**Complete Repomix File Reading:** Read the entire generated repomix file (docs/00_context_engineering/00-repomix-analysis.md) from start to finish:

- **File Summary Section**: Extract purpose, format description, and usage guidelines from the header
- **Processing Notes Analysis**: Parse all metadata including exclusion patterns, file counts, compression settings, and sorting methods
- **User Header Extraction**: Capture any user-provided repository description or context
- **Directory Structure Analysis**: Parse the complete ASCII directory tree structure
- **File Classification**: Categorize all files by type, purpose, and development role
- **Configuration Pattern Analysis**: Examine dotfiles, build configs, package manifests, and CI/CD setups
- **Technology Stack Identification**: Identify languages, frameworks, and tools from file extensions, imports, and dependencies
- **Development Workflow Recognition**: Parse build tools, task runners, testing frameworks, and automation patterns
- **Security and Compliance Notes**: Identify any security-related files, configurations, or findings
- **Content Processing Details**: Understand what content was compressed, excluded, or processed differently

**Comprehensive Overview Generation:** Create a complete but lightweight repository overview:

- **Repository Classification**: Determine project type (web app, CLI, library, template, etc.)
- **Technology Stack Summary**: List primary languages, frameworks, and development tools
- **Project Structure Assessment**: Analyze organization patterns and architectural approach
- **Configuration Analysis**: Summarize key configuration files and their purposes
- **Development Environment**: Document build tools, task runners, and development workflows
- **Documentation Status**: Assess existing documentation and knowledge management

**Overview Document Creation:** Generate `docs/00_context_engineering/01-codebase-awareness-overview.md` with:

- **Source Reference**: Relative path to the repomix file (`00-repomix-analysis.md`)
- **Repomix Metadata Analysis**: Extract and summarize all key metadata from the repomix file header
- **Processing Statistics**: Include file counts, exclusion patterns, and processing configuration
- **Executive Summary**: 2-3 paragraph high-level repository overview
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Organized sections covering all repository aspects discovered in repomix
- **Security and Compliance**: Any security findings or compliance notes from the repomix analysis
- **Quick Reference**: Key files, commands, and entry points for immediate use

**üö´ Constraint:** Focus on structure, configuration, and tooling patterns. Do not perform deep analysis of file contents at this stage.
