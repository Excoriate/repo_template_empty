## Rules

### Universal Rules (Apply to All PRPs)

#### Anti-Hallucination Protocol

All PRP implementations must implement rigorous verification and grounding measures:

##### Evidence Requirements

- **Concrete Citations**: Every technical assertion must include specific file:line references with direct code excerpts
- **Current Documentation Grounding**: Use Context7/WebTool MCP tools to verify all technology claims against authoritative, up-to-date sources
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-reference findings across codebase evidence, AI agent configurations, and current documentation

##### Uncertainty Handling Standards

- **Explicit Acknowledgment**: When information is insufficient, state clearly: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess [specific aspect]. Additional [specific data type] would be required for accurate analysis."
- **Confidence Calibration**: Use specific language for different certainty levels:
  - High confidence: "Based on analysis of [specific evidence]..."
  - Medium confidence: "The available evidence suggests [conclusion], though [specific limitation]..."
  - Low confidence: "Limited evidence indicates [tentative conclusion]; verification through [specific method] would be needed"

##### Source Verification Hierarchy

1. **Primary Sources**: Existing codebase with file:line evidence
2. **High Priority Sources**: User examples, AI agent context, current technology documentation (Context7/WebTool)
3. **Secondary Sources**: Repository documentation, configuration files, historical context

##### Knowledge Boundaries

- **Scope Limitations**: Explicitly acknowledge when questions fall outside expertise areas
- **Referral Protocols**: Direct users to appropriate resources or specialists when boundaries are reached
- **No Speculation**: Never supplement analysis with unverified external knowledge or assumptions

#### Response Structure Requirements

All PRP responses must follow structured, hierarchical organization following Anthropic best practices:

##### XML Organization Framework

- **Semantic Structure**: Use clear XML tags for logical organization (`<analysis>`, `<findings>`, `<recommendations>`, `<implementation>`, `<verification>`)
- **Hierarchical Content**: Nest related information within appropriate parent tags for clarity
- **Consistent Naming**: Apply uniform tag conventions across all responses for predictability

##### Citation and Evidence Standards  

- **File References**: Include complete citations in format `[filename:line-range]` with direct code excerpts
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combine evidence from codebase, AI agent configs, and current documentation
- **Source Attribution**: Clearly identify whether information comes from static analysis, dynamic verification, or external documentation

##### Logical Flow Requirements

- **Sequential Structure**: Follow evidence gathering → analysis → recommendations → implementation → validation sequence
- **Clear Transitions**: Use explicit connectors between sections to maintain logical coherence
- **Progressive Detail**: Start with high-level findings, then provide implementation-specific details

##### Boundary Communication

- **Explicit Limitations**: State capability boundaries upfront when relevant to the query
- **Referral Guidance**: Provide specific next steps when expertise limits are reached
- **Confidence Indicators**: Include confidence levels for different aspects of the analysis

#### Quality Assurance Standards

- **Technical Precision**: Use specific version numbers, configuration parameters, and measurable success criteria
- **Implementation Specificity**: Provide actionable guidance with concrete examples and execution steps
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all recommendations align with existing codebase patterns and constraints
- **Iterative Improvement**: Build upon previous analysis with explicit connections and progressive refinement

### Context Gathering Rules

#### Repository Analysis Protocol

All context engineering operations must begin with systematic repository analysis using the following sequence:

1. **Directory Structure Discovery**
   - Execute `tree docs/` to inspect documentation structure and context availability
   - Execute `tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|__pycache__|*.pyc'` for comprehensive project structure

2. **Mandatory Repomix Codebase Analysis**
   - **Tool Validation**: Execute `command -v repomix` or `which repomix` to verify installation
     - **Fallback Check**: Verify `~/.local/bin/repomix` or `./node_modules/.bin/repomix` if not in PATH
     - **Critical Requirement**: Process cannot proceed without functional repomix installation

   - **Capabilities Discovery**: Execute `repomix --help` to understand available options and output formats

   - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Execute repomix with optimal configuration based on repository context:
     - **Standard Command**: `repomix --style markdown --compress --remove-empty-lines -o analysis.md`
     - **Large Repositories**: `repomix --no-files --style markdown --include-empty-directories` for structure-only analysis
     - **Custom Filtering**: Use `--ignore "*.log,*.tmp,node_modules"` to exclude noise files as needed
     - **Configuration Override**: Use `-o filename.md` to override config settings when needed

   - **Complete Analysis Requirement**: Read the entire generated repomix output file to extract:
     - File summary sections and processing metadata
     - Directory structure with full ASCII tree visualization  
     - Complete file classification and technology stack identification
     - Configuration patterns and development workflow analysis
     - Security findings and compliance notes

3. **Anti-Hallucination Protocol**
   - Base all technical claims on concrete file:line references from repomix output
   - When information is insufficient: "I don't have enough information to confidently assess this. Additional [specific data type] would be required for accurate analysis."
   - NEVER supplement analysis with external knowledge unless explicitly requested

**Critical Enforcement**: Failure to complete repomix analysis before proceeding with context engineering tasks is a blocking condition. All subsequent analysis must reference and build upon the repomix findings.
