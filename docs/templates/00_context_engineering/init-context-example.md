- **Factory Pattern:** Used in `internal/providers/` for AWS service client creation, allowing dynamic instantiation of different AWS service clients based on configuration
- **Strategy Pattern:** Applied in `internal/analyzers/` for different cost analysis algorithms (EC2, RDS, Lambda analyzers), enabling pluggable analysis strategies
- **Repository Pattern:** Implemented in `internal/storage/` for data persistence abstraction, supporting multiple storage backends (local file, S3, database)
- **Observer Pattern:** Used in `internal/reporting/` for notification systems, enabling multiple output formats and delivery mechanisms

**Software Architecture Style:**
Clean Architecture with Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) principles, organized in concentric layers with clear dependency inversion. The architecture separates business logic from external dependencies, enabling testability and maintainability. Core business rules reside in the center, with adapters for AWS APIs, storage systems, and CLI interfaces at the boundaries.

### 7. AI Assistant Guidance

**AI Common Pitfalls:**
- **AWS Cost Calculation Errors:** AI assistants frequently miscalculate AWS pricing by using outdated rates or ignoring regional variations. Always verify cost calculations against current AWS pricing API and account for Reserved Instance discounts, Spot pricing, and volume discounts. For example, assuming standard On-Demand pricing when Reserved Instances are active can lead to 40-60% cost estimation errors.
- **Oversimplified Rightsizing Recommendations:** AI often suggests instance downsizing based solely on CPU utilization without considering memory, network, or I/O requirements. Always analyze all performance metrics and consider workload patterns before recommending instance changes. A web server with 20% CPU but 90% memory utilization should not be downsized.
- **Ignoring AWS Service Interdependencies:** AI assistants may recommend optimizations that break service dependencies, such as reducing RDS instance size without considering connection pool limits or suggesting EBS volume changes that affect IOPS requirements. Always validate recommendations against the complete infrastructure stack.
- **Misunderstanding Enterprise Constraints:** AI often ignores compliance requirements, maintenance windows, and business continuity needs when suggesting optimizations. Enterprise environments require gradual rollouts, rollback plans, and approval processes that AI assistants frequently overlook.

**Behavioral Guidance:**
- **Cost Analysis Approach:** Always start with comprehensive data gathering before making recommendations. Use the tool's multi-account analysis capabilities to understand the complete cost landscape before suggesting optimizations. Present cost savings as ranges with confidence intervals rather than exact figures.
- **Safety-First Recommendations:** Prioritize low-risk optimizations first (unused resources, obvious oversizing) before suggesting complex changes. Always include rollback procedures and impact assessments with every recommendation. For critical systems, recommend testing in staging environments first.
- **Business Context Integration:** Consider business hours, seasonal patterns, and growth projections when analyzing utilization data. A development environment with low weekend utilization is different from a production system with the same pattern. Always ask about business context before making optimization recommendations.
- **Incremental Implementation:** Recommend phased implementation approaches rather than wholesale changes. Start with non-critical resources, monitor results, and gradually expand optimization scope. This approach reduces risk and builds confidence in the optimization process.

**Domain-Specific Patterns:**
- **AWS Cost Optimization Workflow:** Follow the pattern of Discover → Analyze → Recommend → Validate → Implement → Monitor. Each phase has specific deliverables and success criteria. Never skip the validation phase, especially for production systems.
- **Multi-Account Analysis Pattern:** When analyzing enterprise environments, always aggregate data at the organization level before drilling down to individual accounts. Use consolidated billing data to identify cross-account optimization opportunities like Reserved Instance sharing.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management:** Understand that AWS resources have different optimization strategies based on their lifecycle stage. Development resources can be aggressively optimized for cost, while production resources require balanced cost-performance optimization.
- **Compliance and Governance Integration:** Always consider governance policies when recommending changes. Many enterprises have specific instance types, regions, or configuration requirements that must be respected regardless of cost implications.

**Technical Constraints Reference:**
For detailed technical constraints including security requirements, performance benchmarks, integration specifications, and deployment constraints, refer to Section 4 (Implementation Requirements). Key constraints include:
- AWS IAM role-based authentication with least-privilege access
- SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance requirements
- 30-second response time limits for CLI operations
- 512MB maximum memory consumption during analysis
- Support for enterprise environments with 1000+ AWS accounts
